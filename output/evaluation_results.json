Begin with the morning journaling practice we discussed\u2014spend 5 to 10 minutes each morning writing down how you truly feel. This will help you face your emotions honestly and create a stable foundation. Alongside that, try to identify one small activity each day that aligns with your values of honesty, loyalty, and emotional safety\u2014whether it\u2019s reaching out to a trusted friend, setting clear boundaries with yourself, or simply engaging in a grounding activity. These deliberate steps build momentum and help you move out of that stuck place. Commit to this for the next week, and we\u2019ll review your progress together. Does this plan feel doable for you?",
