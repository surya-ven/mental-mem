She told me I was attractive, and have a great personality, etc. I really started to feel better about myself by the time I woke up the next morning. Now, though, I can't stop thinking about her, but I leave to go back to college in a few days and I go to school 4 hours away from her. So now I feel constantly depressed because even if I told her how I felt it wouldn't matter. I feel helpless and I don't know what to do.",

From what you\u2019ve shared, it sounds like the erection issues started a few years ago, seemed to happen out of the blue, and have gradually become more frequent. You\u2019re still attracted to your wife and want things to improve, but the ongoing difficulties are affecting your mood, self-esteem, and marriage.\n\nLet\u2019s start by getting a clearer picture. I\u2019d like to ask a few direct questions:\n- When you first noticed this problem, were there any major changes in your life (stress, health, relationship dynamics, work, etc.)?\n- Are you noticing erections in other situations, such as during masturbation or when waking up in the morning?\n- Have you had any changes to your physical health (medications, new diagnoses, weight, sleep, alcohol or drug use)?\n- How does your wife respond when this happens\u2014do you feel supported, or is there tension or pressure?\n\nThe reason I\u2019m asking is, erection issues can have many causes: stress, anxiety, depression, medical conditions, relationship patterns, or a combination. Getting specific can help us target the right solutions. Can you share a bit about these areas?"

I don\u2019t take any regular medication, I\u2019m generally healthy, maybe put on a bit of weight but nothing extreme. I do drink more than I used to, maybe 2-3 drinks some nights to help me relax. No drugs.\n\nWhen it happens with my wife, she tries to be supportive, but I can tell she is frustrated and disappointed. Sometimes we end up arguing about it. I feel a lot of pressure to perform. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I worry about it before we even get close, and that makes it even worse."

From what you\u2019ve described, several things could be feeding into this problem:\n\n1. **Performance Anxiety:** It sounds like worrying about whether you\u2019ll have an erection is causing a negative cycle\u2014anticipating problems can actually trigger them. This is very common, and it can build up over time, especially if you\u2019ve had a few negative experiences.\n2. **Relationship Tension:** Even when your wife tries to be supportive, feeling her disappointment and arguing are adding more pressure, which doesn\u2019t help. This can make sex feel less safe and more like a test.\n3. **Alcohol Use:** While moderate drinking can help people relax, alcohol is a known cause of erection difficulties, especially if you\u2019re using it regularly to deal with stress or pressure.\n4. **Mood and Self-esteem:** Ongoing stress, depression, or self-criticism can all affect erections. The more you feel bad about yourself, the harder it is to break the cycle.\n5. **Physical Factors:** Since you still get some morning erections, there\u2019s a good chance the problem is more psychological than physical, although some physical factors (like weight, general health, sleep, or even minor hormonal changes) can contribute.\n\n**Action Steps:**\n- Cut back on alcohol for at least a few weeks and see if you notice any change.\n- Focus on non-sexual intimacy with your wife (cuddling, massage, sensual touch with no expectation of intercourse) to reduce pressure.\n- If you start to worry about performance, practice grounding yourself in the moment (deep breathing, focusing on sensations instead of outcome).\n- Consider seeing a doctor for a basic health check to rule out any underlying issues.\n- If you\u2019re open to it, working together with your wife on communication and support can make a big difference.\n\nHow do you feel about these initial steps? Is there something here you\u2019d like to focus on first, or do you have questions about any of these points?"

I\u2019ll try cutting back on drinking and focusing on just being close with my wife without the pressure of intercourse.

Many people fall into the same cycle, believing that if they just force themselves or try harder, things will improve, but this usually increases anxiety and makes the issue worse. You\u2019re right to focus on breaking this pattern instead of pushing through. \n\nCutting back on alcohol and practicing non-sexual closeness are both strong first steps. Give yourself permission to take the focus off performance for now. As you and your wife re-build trust and comfort in being close without pressure, it will help reset your body\u2019s response. If you notice progress, even small steps, make sure to acknowledge them\u2014that\u2019s important for rebuilding confidence.\n\nIf you find the anxiety keeps taking over, we can look at more targeted strategies next, including specific techniques for managing worry or working together with your wife as a team. For now, try these changes for a couple of weeks and note any shifts, even minor ones. I\u2019m here for support and to help you adjust the plan as needed. Let me know how it goes, or if you have any questions or concerns as you try these steps."

It\u2019s completely normal to hope for quick improvement, but it\u2019s also normal for this process to have ups and downs. Even with changes in approach, it often takes time for your body and mind to break out of old cycles\u2014sometimes setbacks are part of that process, not a sign of failure.\n\nHere\u2019s what I want you to know:\n\n1. One setback doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re back to square one. The anxiety about the problem is deeply conditioned, and even with progress, it can resurface under pressure or expectation.\n2. The fact that you\u2019re still attracted to your wife and want things to improve is a strong foundation to build on.\n3. Feeling defeated now is understandable, but it doesn\u2019t mean things can\u2019t improve\u2014this is a signal that we may need to add some new strategies.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- For now, put intercourse aside as a goal. Focus on all forms of physical closeness\u2014touch, kissing, massage, even sensual play\u2014without any expectation or attempt at penetration. This is called \u2018sensate focus\u2019 and it\u2019s a proven way to retrain your body\u2019s response, reduce anxiety, and build positive experiences together. If at any point you become aroused, allow it, but don\u2019t shift the focus to intercourse.\n- Talk openly with your wife and share that setbacks are normal, and that you\u2019re both working as a team, not against each other. Sometimes including her in the process relieves pressure because it\u2019s not just your burden to bear.\n- If the emotional impact is heavy, consider checking in with your doctor about mood or anxiety. Sometimes counseling or short-term medication can help break the cycle.\n- Keep a simple log of your experiences\u2014what you tried, how you felt, and any small wins (even non-sexual ones). This can help identify patterns and build confidence over time.\n\nMost importantly, don\u2019t let a single setback convince you that lasting change isn\u2019t possible. Would you like some more detailed guidance on how to do sensate focus exercises, or help with talking to your wife about being a team in this?"

I want to be direct: setbacks like this are common and don\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed or that things can\u2019t improve. The pressure to \"get it right\" after making changes can sometimes spike your anxiety even more. This is a sign that the cycle of anxiety and performance pressure is still active\u2014it takes time and consistent practice to break that pattern.\n\nLet\u2019s consolidate what we\u2019ve learned: \n- Trying to \"relax\" with the hope that things will instantly improve can actually keep the focus on performance, which maintains anxiety.\n- The real goal for now isn\u2019t to \"achieve\" an erection or intercourse, but to completely take the pressure off and rebuild positive, pressure-free experiences with your wife.\n\nHere\u2019s a clear next step: \n1. Commit together with your wife to put intercourse on hold for now. Instead, focus on sensate focus exercises\u2014a step-by-step plan to rebuild physical closeness and retrain your body\u2019s response without performance pressure.

I feel like I\u2019ll never be able to become a counselor, or there will be a whole list of things I can\u2019t do. I\u2019m also scared of antidepressants. This year my doctor gave me some for my hip, and I ended up passing out\u2014which was terrifying. Pretty much everyone I know says antidepressants are a bad idea and you\u2019re better off getting treatment without them.\n\nI\u2019m worried that if I go in and admit how bad I feel, they\u2019ll send me to some clinic and force me to take meds because they\u2019ll think I can\u2019t make decisions for myself. I\u2019m not really suicidal, but I\u2019m not really taking care of myself either. I even heard they still use electroshock therapy, which I\u2019d never want. Part of me thinks I\u2019m better off trying to handle it on my own, like self-help stuff. But the truth is, I\u2019ve been a mess emotionally since elementary school, and even though I\u2019ve graduated and tried to stay positive, I can\u2019t deny that I\u2019m still not doing well."

It takes a lot of courage to even talk about these things, especially with your past experiences and the stories you\u2019ve heard from others.\n\nYou\u2019re asking really important questions: about records, about your future as a counselor, about medication and forced treatment. These are not small worries\u2014they touch on your sense of safety, control, and identity. I want to say first, you\u2019re not alone in having these fears. Many people\u2014especially those who want to go into helping professions\u2014worry about the impact of a diagnosis. It makes sense that after what happened with your medication, you\u2019d feel especially cautious about anything being prescribed, and you\u2019d want to avoid anything that feels out of your control.\n\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, I don\u2019t hear anything that means you\u2019d automatically be forced into treatment or lose your ability to make decisions. Usually, treatments like medication or electroconvulsive therapy are only considered when someone is in severe crisis or unable to keep themselves safe\u2014and even then, people\u2019s choices are respected as much as possible. But that doesn\u2019t erase how real your worries feel.\n\nIt also sounds like you\u2019re tired\u2014tired of trying to fix things alone, but also scared that asking for help might make things worse. That\u2019s such a tough place to be. If you\u2019d like, we can talk through what actually happens when someone talks to a doctor about depression, what your rights are, and what kinds of support exist that don\u2019t involve medication or losing control. Or we can focus on self-help and ways to care for yourself right now. My main goal is to help you feel understood and empowered, whatever you decide. How does all of this feel to you?

Years of bullying can make anyone start to believe the worst things about themselves, especially if you never get real support. \n\nThe truth is, being 'skinny' or changing your body isn\u2019t a magic fix for how you feel about yourself, especially if people still find ways to criticize you. What really needs to change are the beliefs you have about yourself, and letting go of the idea that other people\u2019s harsh words are facts\u2014they're not.\n\nYou asked how to stop letting those voices get in your head. It takes practice, but you can start by noticing when you hear those thoughts and immediately reminding yourself: 'That\u2019s what bullies said, not the truth.' Or even, 'That\u2019s their opinion, but I don\u2019t have to accept it.' It might help to write these reminders down, or even say them out loud. The more you do it, the easier it will get to separate their voices from your own.\n\nAbout your parents\u2014it's really frustrating and lonely not to feel believed or supported. Even if they say you\u2019re not fat, it sounds like you don\u2019t feel understood. It might help to try again and be specific: tell them exactly how the bullying makes you feel and why talking to someone outside the family matters to you. If talking is hard, maybe write them a letter.\n\nYou said you want to try again to make changes and not stop this time. That\u2019s a strong thing to say. But I\u2019d encourage you to focus on making changes for how you feel and take care of yourself, not just to look different for others. Real change is about being kinder to yourself and building up your self-worth.\n\nWould you be willing to try a small daily habit this week\u2014like writing down one thing your body has done for you that day (even something simple like 'helped me walk to class'), and when you notice a mean thought, write a comeback? We can talk about what worked and what was tough next time. And if you want, we can brainstorm more ways to get support, even if your parents aren\u2019t ready to help yet."

When you\u2019ve spent years hearing negative things about yourself, trying to say something different\u2014even something neutral\u2014can feel fake or pointless at first. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing it wrong or that you\u2019re stuck like this forever.\n\nThe fact that you even tried, even for a couple days, is a big deal. It shows you care about yourself enough to give something new a chance, and that actually matters.\n\nThe bullying is not your fault, and I\u2019m really sorry it\u2019s still happening. Being surrounded by people who put you down makes it so much harder to believe anything good about yourself. It can honestly take a long time for new thoughts to feel true, especially when you\u2019re still in that environment.\n\nHere\u2019s my direct advice: For now, forget about trying to force yourself to say positive things you don\u2019t believe. Instead, try something simpler\u2014can you just notice when a mean thought pops up and say, 'That\u2019s not fair to me'? You don\u2019t have to believe anything positive yet; just remind yourself that the way you\u2019re being treated isn\u2019t fair or deserved.\n\nAlso, if writing feels too hard, you could try drawing, listening to music that matches your mood, or even just taking a moment to breathe when things feel overwhelming. Small steps count.\n\nWould you be willing to try just that one thing this week: when a mean thought or memory comes up, say to yourself (out loud or in your head), 'That\u2019s not fair to me'? And if you want, we can talk more about ways to protect yourself from bullying, or find supportive people, even if your parents aren\u2019t ready to help yet. How does that sound to you?"

It\u2019s okay if nothing feels good yet. Survival is a victory in itself when things are this hard.\n\nHere\u2019s my honest advice: Instead of focusing on changing your thoughts or feelings right now, let\u2019s try to focus on protecting your energy and having small moments where you can breathe a little easier. This might mean taking short breaks for yourself during the day, even just five minutes to listen to music or step outside, or finding one place or activity where you feel a little less judged\u2014even if it\u2019s just in your room.\n\nAnd if you notice the mean thoughts or memories coming up, just notice them and let them pass\u2014no need to argue with them for now. Sometimes, just giving yourself permission not to fight your brain can be a relief.\n\nWould you be willing to keep track for a week of any moments\u2014no matter how small\u2014when you feel even a bit less stressed or less affected by what others say? It could be when you\u2019re listening to a song, being with someone kinder, or even just when you\u2019re alone and not thinking about school. You don't need to force good feelings\u2014just notice when things feel a tiny bit lighter, even if only for a minute.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about what you notice next time, and from there, we can look for ways to build on those moments.

From what you've shared, it sounds like the last few months have been really tough\u2014especially after your ex left unexpectedly.

I also hear that you\u2019re trying to do all the right things\u2014staying active, eating well, pursuing your interests\u2014but you\u2019re not feeling the way you hoped. You mentioned feeling shut down and afraid to let yourself be happy, worried it could all be taken away again. That sounds exhausting and lonely.\n\nBefore we go further, I want this space to fit your needs. Some people prefer direct feedback or guidance, while others find it more helpful to have a reflective conversation, exploring thoughts and feelings together. What style of communication feels most supportive to you right now\u2014more direct or more reflective? And as we get started, what would you most like to get out of these sessions?

I want to trust my friends and family again. And I just want to feel like I\u2019m growing, not stuck in the same place.

Sometimes, the pain goes deeper than activities alone can reach.\n\nI\u2019m also hearing how much it matters to you to feel safe with yourself and others\u2014to trust, to relax, and to be real, without fear of judgment or abandonment. It\u2019s really understandable that your ex leaving so suddenly, without explanation, would shake that foundation. Sometimes, when trust is broken so unexpectedly, it can make us question everything, even the people who haven\u2019t hurt us.\n\nWould you feel comfortable sharing more about what it\u2019s been like, day-to-day, since your ex left? For example, do certain situations or interactions with friends or family stand out as especially difficult or triggering for you? Or is it more of a constant background worry or tension?

Our minds try to make sense of what happened, sometimes by looking for threats everywhere, even when there\u2019s no real evidence. The panic and urge to withdraw are ways your brain tries to protect you from being hurt again, even if it ends up making you feel more isolated.\n\nWould you be willing to talk a little about what your relationship with your ex felt like, especially in the time leading up to when she left?

Your mind is working overtime to protect you.\n\nOne thing I notice is how much compassion you show yourself, even as you struggle (like when you say you know it\u2019s probably not true but still feel anxious). That\u2019s an important strength. Would you like to explore ways to rebuild trust in yourself and others at a pace that feels manageable, or would it feel better right now to focus on understanding and accepting how you\u2019re feeling?"

For example, are there moments when you catch yourself before withdrawing, or times when you let someone in just a little more than you would have in the beginning?

The urge to pull away and the urge to reach out can exist side by side. Instead of judging yourself for having those thoughts, what would it be like to treat them as signals\u2014messages from a part of you that just wants to feel safe and valued? If you notice that self-doubt creeping in, maybe try asking yourself: 'What would I say to a friend who was feeling this way?' Would you be able to show yourself even a fraction of that kindness?\n\nIf you\u2019d like, we can talk about some specific ways to practice that self-compassion, or explore ways to take small, safe risks in connecting with others at your own pace.

Afterward, instead of judging how it went, notice what it felt like to try. Was it scary? Did you feel a little proud, or more vulnerable?

Sometimes, when our usual coping tools stop working, it can help to try something new or change how we approach the activities. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n- Change the focus: Instead of doing creative activities or exercise to \u2018fix\u2019 how you feel, try doing them with the sole intention of being present, without any pressure for it to help or change anything.\n- Tiny connections: If reaching out to someone feels overwhelming, could you aim for the smallest possible connection\u2014sending a meme, replying with a few words, or even just sitting in the same room as someone without talking?\n- Sensory grounding: Sometimes focusing on your senses (noticing the feeling of warm water, a favorite scent, or music) can help you feel a bit more anchored in your body, even for a few moments.\n- Self-compassion breaks: When you notice your inner critic (\u201cI should be past this\u201d), pause and gently tell yourself, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to feel this way. I\u2019m doing my best.\u201d\n\nIf any of these sound worth trying, we can talk about how to make them feel as low-pressure as possible.

We respectfully tried not to have sex, but after hours of trying to resist each other, we gave in and we had sex. After that, I slept at her house every night for almost two weeks. Then one day, she went to her family\u2019s house on Thanksgiving and everything changed. Within the short time we were together, we got so close and serious really fast. We had finally found each other. We told each other that we loved each other all the time, even while we were making love. A few days after Thanksgiving, she told me that we would have to go back to her original plans of seeing each other much less frequently. I was very hurt and didn\u2019t understand. Then another week later, she told me she couldn\u2019t do it at all anymore. I was crushed!\n   A few days later, she tells me how much she\u2019s missing me and \u201clet\u2019s get together for lunch\u201d or something like that. Then about two weeks later, we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other (in love, not just sex), but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her. So for her child\u2019s sake, she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen. She had told me all about him previously, and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him, but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child. Our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged, but she is torn and confused. She doesn\u2019t even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly. I know she needs time, and all I can do is take care of myself. We have agreed to remain friends, and if this doesn\u2019t work out for her, we will try again. I\u2019m completely in love with her, and I\u2019m in extreme pain.",

What\u2019s important is that you notice your reaction, and instead of judging yourself for it, you\u2019re able to acknowledge how much this still matters to you.\n\nLet\u2019s reflect for a moment: Despite how hard this is, what have you learned about yourself in these moments of setback? Are there any strengths or needs that have become clearer to you through this pain?"

It sounds like part of your healing will involve learning how to anchor your self-worth within yourself, so you\u2019re not as vulnerable to these kinds of setbacks in the future.\n\nFor our next session, would you be willing to try a specific exercise or reflection that helps you strengthen your sense of self outside of this relationship? For example, we could focus on identifying and nurturing activities, qualities, or connections that remind you of your value, even when you\u2019re feeling pain or uncertainty.

Most likely, if you take a short break\u2014like a walk\u2014he\u2019ll be in the same place when you get back. If he hasn\u2019t expressed any intention to harm himself, that risk is low. And if he does think you don\u2019t care, it\u2019s not because you took care of yourself for half an hour; it\u2019s because depression distorts things. Your responsibility is to yourself as well as to him.\n\nYou can\u2019t sacrifice your well-being to try and protect him from every bad feeling. That\u2019s not sustainable. The setback you felt last week isn\u2019t a failure\u2014it\u2019s proof that this is hard and that guilt is something you\u2019ll need to practice moving through, not around.\n\nHere\u2019s what I want you to do: Keep taking those small breaks\u2014start with something simple, like another walk or some time reading alone, even if guilt comes up. Afterward, write down what actually happened (not what you feared might happen).

This doesn\u2019t mean your efforts aren\u2019t valuable; it just means that for real change, you\u2019ll likely need to talk with your partner about trying a new approach together before you\u2019re actually in the middle of an argument.\n\nFor our next step, I suggest you have a short, calm conversation with your partner\u2014at a time when you\u2019re not arguing\u2014about wanting to work as a team on communication. You could say something like, 'I don\u2019t like how we both end up upset when we argue, and I\u2019d like for us to try something different together.' Ask if they\u2019d be willing to agree on a simple ground rule for your next disagreement, like taking a short pause when things get heated, or both agreeing to use 'I' statements. \n\nDoes that sound like something you\u2019d be willing to try before your next session?"

I want to be direct: Even though you don\u2019t drink often, past incidents involving alcohol may have left her feeling uncertain or hurt, so those memories resurface when she\u2019s feeling vulnerable or under stress. \n\nInstead of raising your voice, which you\u2019ve already noticed doesn\u2019t work, try focusing on listening and summarizing her concerns\u2014even if you disagree. For example, you could say, 'I hear that you\u2019re worried because of things I\u2019ve done before. It\u2019s important to you that I\u2019m consistent now.' This helps her feel heard, lowering the chance she\u2019ll go on the attack. Then, calmly share your own feelings and boundaries: 'I want to solve things without bringing up the past each time we argue.' \n\nWould you be willing to try reflecting her feelings first before defending yourself?

When she asks open-ended questions or brings up the past, what specifically does she say that triggers you the most? What do you notice in your body or thoughts right before you start to get loud?

This practice helps bring your attention back to the present, which can calm your body and interrupt the cycle of catastrophic thinking. \n\nIt might feel a little awkward at first, but with practice, it can give you a sense of control when things start to spiral. Would you be willing to try it this week when you notice those old fears cropping up? Then, next time we meet, we can talk about how it went\u2014what was helpful, and what felt challenging."

When you feel the urge, try:\n\n1. Get up and move\u2014try doing 20 jumping jacks or going for a brisk walk. Intense movement can help your brain and body change gears.\n2. Hold something cold (like ice) in your hand or run your wrists under cold water for 30 seconds.\n3. Try the \u2018rubber band\u2019 method\u2014snap a rubber band on your wrist, but not hard enough to hurt, just enough for sensation.\n4. Text or message someone (even if it\u2019s a distraction, it\u2019s not isolating).\n5. Write out exactly what you\u2019re feeling, as messy as it comes, and then tear up the paper.\n\nWill you pick 1 or 2 of these to try next time you have a strong urge, and let me know how it goes?"

You tried some of the strategies, and even though they felt hard or didn\u2019t fix things right away, that\u2019s part of the process. New coping skills almost always feel weird or useless at first. The fact that you didn\u2019t give in to the urge, even when it was strong, tells me you\u2019re fighting harder than you think. \n\nLet\u2019s get very practical. First, about sleep: scrolling on your phone at night keeps your brain wired and makes the depression and urges worse. Tonight, put your charger across the room so you have to get out of bed to reach your phone. If you can, turn on \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 by midnight, even if you\u2019re not sleeping yet. The goal is progress, not perfection.\n\nFor the urges: When movement or writing feels bad, try a different tool. Fill a sink with cold water and dunk your face in for a few seconds, or grip something really cold. If that\u2019s too much, try squeezing a stress ball or even tearing up paper. The key is to change the physical state of your body and break the cycle, no matter how small it seems.\n\nAbout school: The first attempt is always the hardest. Next time you see that kid, just say 'hey' or ask a quick question about class. You don\u2019t have to force a real conversation yet. That tiny bit of contact is what matters now.\n\nMost important: If you feel like you\u2019re getting close to hurting yourself, text a crisis line or reach out to a safe adult, even if it feels pointless. You don\u2019t have to handle this alone. Do you think you can try these tweaks for the next few days, even if you slip up sometimes?"

You\u2019re learning which strategies shift your state (cold water helped, music helped a bit), and you\u2019re fighting the urge every night. That\u2019s you taking control, not the other way around.\n\nThe key insight here is: Even when things feel overwhelming, small, uncomfortable actions can interrupt the urge and keep you safe. You\u2019re proving to yourself, step by step, that you can change your patterns.\n\nHere\u2019s what I want you to focus on for this week. 1) Keep the phone across the room every night, even if you slip up. 2) Whenever you have an urge, pick either cold water or another physical strategy (like squeezing something or tearing paper). 3) Try to have one more short real-life conversation at school, even if it\u2019s just a sentence. 4) If an urge feels like it\u2019s getting too close, message a helpline or a safe person\u2014don\u2019t wait until it\u2019s out of control.\n\nAre you willing to agree to these tasks, and write down which ones felt even a little bit easier by next session?
