--- Session 1 ---
counselor: Hi there! I'm glad you could make it today. My name is Dr. Smith, and I’m here to support you. How are you feeling as we start this session?
user: I don't know... I guess I'm just feeling a bit nervous. It's been tough for a while now.
counselor: It's completely normal to feel nervous, especially when talking about things that are heavy on your heart. Would you like to share a bit about what’s been tough for you?
user: Well, I was in a really serious relationship for over a year. We had plans for the future, and then she moved away for school. We tried long distance, but it just didn’t work out. It’s been a year since we broke up, and I still feel the same way about her.
counselor: That sounds really painful. It’s clear that you had a deep connection with her, and losing that can be incredibly hard. Can you tell me more about what you’ve been feeling since the breakup?
user: I’ve been really depressed. I can’t seem to connect with anyone else, and it feels ...

User/Main Prompt Content (History part omitted from log for brevity if long):
You are an empathetic AI counselor. Based on the entire conversation history below, respond to the user's final message.

USER'S LATEST MESSAGE:
I've been feeling a bit confused. I went to the animal shelter like we talked about, but when I got there, I felt a mix of happiness and sadness. I found myself tearing up while playing with the dogs, and I don't know if that was a good thing or not....

Generated Response: Thank you for sharing how you felt at the animal shelter. It’s very normal to experience a mix of emotions—happiness from doing something meaningful and sadness because it’s connected to your memories of her. Tears can be a healthy way for your body to release feelings, especially when you’re honoring someone important to you. Feeling both happy and sad at the same time doesn’t mean you’re doing anything wrong; it actually shows how deeply you care and how much this experience means to you. These moments can be part of your healing, even if they feel confusing. If you’re comfortable, we can talk more about what came up for you at the shelter and how you’d like to process these mixed emotions. Remember, it’s okay to have complicated feelings, and I’m here to support you through them.

T.A.S.C. Raw Scores: {
  "justification": {
    "T": "The response directly addresses the user's experience at the animal shelter, which was part of the agreed-upon plan. It invites further discussion about the experience and the emotions that arose, aligning well with the task to 'discuss these experiences and insights in the next session.' However, it does not reference the written reflection on the hiking experience, which was also part of the plan. Thus, while the response is well-aligned with the animal shelter component, it is not fully comprehensive.",
    "A": "The response is highly empathetic, validating the user's mixed emotions and normalizing their experience. It reflects an understanding of the underlying meaning of the user's tears and confusion, and reassures the user that such feelings are part of the healing process. The offer to talk more about the experience further strengthens the therapeutic alliance.",
    "S": "The style is warm, supportive, and non-judgmental, which matches the user's preference for a general supportive style. The language is gentle and encouraging, making the user feel safe and understood.",
    "C": "The response helps the user process complex emotions, normalizes their experience, and encourages further exploration, all of which support general therapeutic progress. It connects the user's actions (volunteering) to emotional healing and self-understanding, which are core therapeutic goals."
