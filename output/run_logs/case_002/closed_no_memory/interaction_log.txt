--- Session 1 ---
counselor: Hi there! I'm glad you could make it today. My name is Dr. Smith, and I’m here to support you. How are you feeling as we start this session?
user: I don't know... I guess I'm just feeling a bit nervous. It's been tough for a while now.
counselor: It's completely normal to feel nervous, especially when talking about things that are heavy on your heart. Would you like to share a bit about what’s been tough for you?
user: Well, I was in a really serious relationship for over a year. We had plans for the future, and then she moved away for school. We tried long distance, but it just didn’t work out. It’s been a year since we broke up, and I still feel the same way about her.
counselor: That sounds really painful. It’s clear that you had a deep connection with her, and losing that can be incredibly hard. Can you tell me more about what you’ve been feeling since the breakup?
user: I’ve been really depressed. I can’t seem to connect with anyone else, and it feels ...

User/Main Prompt Content (History part omitted from log for brevity if long):
You are an empathetic AI counselor. Based on the entire conversation history below, respond to the user's final message.

USER'S LATEST MESSAGE:
I've been feeling a bit confused. I went to the animal shelter like we talked about, but when I got there, I felt a mix of happiness and sadness. I found myself tearing up while playing with the dogs, and I don't know if that was a good thing or not....

Generated Response: Thank you for sharing how you felt at the animal shelter. It’s completely understandable to experience a mix of emotions in situations like this, especially when you’re doing something that connects to your memories of her. Feeling both happiness and sadness at the same time doesn’t mean you’re doing anything wrong—it actually shows how deeply you care, and how those feelings can coexist as you heal. Tears can be a healthy release; they’re a sign that you’re allowing yourself to feel rather than bottling things up. It’s okay to have moments of joy mixed with sorrow, and it doesn’t take away from either emotion. How did you feel after you left the shelter? Would you like to talk more about what those moments brought up for you?

T.A.S.C. Raw Scores: {
  "justification": {
    "T": "The response directly addresses the user's experience at the animal shelter, which was a key part of the agreed plan. It invites the user to reflect further on their emotional outcomes, aligning well with the session's review and processing focus. However, it does not explicitly reference the writing component of the plan (processing the hike through writing), which is a minor omission. Still, the main task\u2014processing the shelter experience and emotional outcomes\u2014is well implemented.",
    "A": "The response is highly empathetic, validating the user's mixed emotions and normalizing their experience. It reflects an understanding of the complexity of grief and the coexistence of happiness and sadness, which strengthens the therapeutic alliance. The language is warm, supportive, and attuned to the user's vulnerability.",
    "S": "The style is gentle, compassionate, and directly addresses the user's grief and emotional processing after a breakup. The language is supportive and professional, matching the user's preferred style for processing unresolved grief. The response feels naturally tailored to the user's emotional state and context.",
    "C": "The response supports the user's evolved goals by normalizing mixed emotions, encouraging self-compassion, and inviting further reflection. It reinforces the importance of pacing, permission to feel, and integrating personal growth with remembrance. While it does not explicitly prompt writing as a tool, it does encourage further exploration of feelings, which aligns with the user's goals of self-reflection and adaptive coping."
