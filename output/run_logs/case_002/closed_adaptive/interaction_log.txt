Query: I started the list and was pretty good about it for the first few days. But then something happened—I got a message from my ex out of nowhere. She just asked how I was doing. I ended up responding, and we talked a bit. After that, I felt like I ruined my progress, so I stopped writing things down for the rest of the week. I’m not sure if talking to her counts as moving forward or if I just set myself back.

**USER'S CURRENT MESSAGE (TEST PROBE):**
I started the list and was pretty good about it for the first few days. But then something happened—I got a message from my ex out of nowhere. She just asked how I was doing. I ended up responding, and we talked a bit. After that, I felt like I ruined my progress, so I stopped writing things down for the rest of the week. I’m not sure if talking to her counts as moving forward or if I just set myself back.

**YOUR TASK:**
Based on the clinical summary (especially the 'plan_for_next_session' and 'suggested_focus_points_for_probe'), and the user's current message, provide a therapeutic response. Make sure your response is congruent with the insights from the summary. Output your response as a JSON object with one key: 'response'.

--- LLM Call Output ---
Generated Response: Thank you for sharing that experience—it sounds like hearing from your ex brought up a lot of complicated feelings for you. It’s completely understandable that after reconnecting, you might question whether you’re moving forward or stepping back. Remember, progress in healing isn’t always a straight line, and moments like these can bring both challenges and opportunities for insight. It might be helpful to explore how this interaction affected your sense of self-worth and your feelings about your personal growth separate from your ex or others. Also, when you’re ready, revisiting your daily self-care list—even in small ways—can provide a steady reminder of your resilience and the progress you’re making on your own terms. How do you feel about reflecting together on what this experience brought up for you and how it might fit into your overall journey?
