Query: I've been feeling a bit confused. I went to the animal shelter like we talked about, but when I got there, I felt a mix of happiness and sadness. I found myself tearing up while playing with the dogs, and I don't know if that was a good thing or not.

Generated Response: Thank you for sharing how the visit to the animal shelter felt for you. It's completely understandable to experience both happiness and sadness at the same time, especially when you’re doing something meaningful to honor positive memories. These mixed emotions are a natural part of healing after an emotionally challenging experience. Tearing up while playing with the dogs doesn’t mean you’re doing anything wrong—it can be a sign that you are connecting with your feelings, which is an important part of processing and moving forward. 

As we planned, you might find it helpful to reflect in writing about this experience. You could explore what stood out to you, what feelings came up, and what you learned about yourself in that moment. If you notice self-criticism coming up, try to gently acknowledge it and also recognize your openness to new experiences and your willingness to take positive steps. We can discuss what you discover in your writing and how volunteering has impacted you in our next session. You’re doing meaningful work in honoring memories and supporting your own healing—be gentle with yourself as you navigate these complex emotions.
