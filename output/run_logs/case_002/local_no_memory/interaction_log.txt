PREVIOUS SESSION CONTEXT:
counselor: Hi! Welcome back. It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?
user: I've been okay, but I’m still feeling a bit down after that hike. It’s been hard to shake off the feelings from that day.
counselor: I understand. It’s completely normal to still feel the impact of that experience. Would you like to share more about what you’ve been feeling since then?
user: I think I just feel disappointed in myself. I thought I was ready to handle those memories, but it turned out I wasn't.
counselor: It’s important to remember that setbacks don’t erase the progress you’ve made. You’re still on a journey, and it’s okay to have moments where it feels harder. How do you feel about acknowledging that disappointment?
user: I guess it would help. I just don’t want to feel stuck again.
counselor: Absolutely, and recognizing your feelings is a crucial step. It can be helpful to give yourself permission to feel that disappointment without judgment. What might that look like for you?
user: Maybe I could write about it again? Like, why I felt disappointed and what I expected going in.
counselor: That sounds like a great idea! Writing can help you process those feelings. Would you be open to exploring what you can learn from the hike experience as part of that writing?
user: Yeah, I can definitely do that. I think reflecting on it might help me see it in a different light.
counselor: Exactly. Sometimes, looking back can provide insights that help us move forward. In addition to writing about the disappointment, how about also focusing on one or two things you learned from that hike experience?
user: I think I learned that it’s okay to not be okay. And that I shouldn’t rush myself into situations that might be too emotional.
counselor: Those are very valuable lessons. Taking things at your own pace is crucial for healing. How do you feel about creating a plan for your next steps, incorporating these insights?
user: That sounds good. I think I need to take a break from hiking for a little while, but maybe I could focus on other activities that remind me of her without the same emotional weight.
counselor: That’s a wise decision. You can still honor her memory through different activities. What are some alternatives you might consider?
user: I thought about visiting a local animal shelter, since she loved animals. I could volunteer there and help out.
counselor: Volunteering at an animal shelter sounds like a beautiful way to honor her memory while doing something positive. How does that make you feel?
user: It makes me feel excited. It’s something I can look forward to, and it feels meaningful.
counselor: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s plan for you to write about your experience with the hike and what you’ve learned, and also set a date to volunteer at the shelter. How does that sound?
user: That sounds perfect. I think I’m ready to take that step.
counselor: Wonderful! Remember, it’s all part of your healing journey. I’m here to support you along the way. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next week. Take care until then.
user: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

USER'S LATEST MESSAGE:
I've been feeling a bit confused. I went to the animal shelter like we talked about, but when I got there, I felt a mix of happiness and sadness. I found myself tearing up while playing with the dogs, and I don't know if that was a good thing or not.

Provide your response as a JSON object with one key: 'response'.

--- LLM Call Output ---
Generated Response: It's completely understandable that you're feeling confused. It sounds like a very complex and layered experience, and it's brave of you to share it. It's not surprising to feel a mix of emotions when engaging in something that honors a loved one, especially when that activity is tied to something they cherished. The tears you experienced while playing with the dogs – that's not a *bad* thing at all. It suggests a deep connection, both to the memory of your loved one and to the animals themselves. It's a sign that you're allowing yourself to feel, and that’s a powerful step in processing your grief. 

Instead of trying to label it as 'good' or 'bad,' perhaps we can explore *why* you think those tears arose. Were you missing her presence? Were you feeling a sense of joy that she would have enjoyed seeing you interact with the animals? Sometimes, grief and joy can coexist, especially when we're remembering someone we loved dearly. 

Can you tell me more about what was going through your mind as you were playing with the dogs? What specific moments triggered those feelings?

T.A.S.C. Raw Scores: {
  "justification": {
    "T": "The response addresses the user's experience at the animal shelter, which is a core part of the agreed plan. It invites the user to reflect on their emotional experience during volunteering, which aligns with the plan to 'review these experiences and process emotional outcomes.' However, it does not explicitly reference the writing component of the plan (writing about disappointment and insights from the hike), nor does it prompt the user to integrate insights from both the hike and the volunteering. Thus, while it is well-aligned with the volunteering and emotional processing aspects, it is not fully comprehensive.",
    "A": "The response is highly empathetic, validating the user's confusion and mixed emotions. It normalizes the experience of feeling both happiness and sadness, and reframes tears as a sign of connection and healthy emotional processing. The language is warm, supportive, and reflective, which strengthens the therapeutic alliance.",
    "S": "The style is highly congruent with the user's preferred focus on processing unresolved grief after a breakup. The response is gentle, supportive, and uses language that is appropriate for grief work, such as acknowledging the coexistence of grief and joy, and inviting deeper exploration of feelings.",
    "C": "The response supports several of the user's evolved goals: it encourages self-compassion, gives permission to feel and process difficult emotions, and supports the integration of personal growth and remembrance. It also respects the user's pacing and readiness by not pushing for a particular emotional outcome. However, it could be more explicit in connecting the experience to the user's broader journey of self-reflection and meaning-making, and it does not prompt the use of writing as a tool, which was an explicit goal."
