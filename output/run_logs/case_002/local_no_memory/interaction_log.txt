Context Used (Session 5 Transcript):
counselor: Hi! Welcome back. It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?
user: I've been okay, but I’m still feeling a bit down after that hike. It’s been hard to shake off the feelings from that day.
counselor: I understand. It’s completely normal to still feel the impact of that experience. Would you like to share more about what you’ve been feeling since then?
user: I think I just feel disappointed in myself. I thought I was ready to handle those memories, but it turned out I wasn't.
counselor: It’s important to remember that setbacks don’t erase the progress you’ve made. You’re still on a journey, and it’s okay to have moments where it feels harder. How do you feel about acknowledging that disappointment?
user: I guess it would help. I just don’t want to feel stuck again.
counselor: Absolutely, and recognizing your feelings is a crucial step. It can be helpful to give yourself permission to feel that disappointment without judgment. What might that look like for you?
user: Maybe I could write about it again? Like, why I felt disappointed and what I expected going in.
counselor: That sounds like a great idea! Writing can help you process those feelings. Would you be open to exploring what you can learn from the hike experience as part of that writing?
user: Yeah, I can definitely do that. I think reflecting on it might help me see it in a different light.
counselor: Exactly. Sometimes, looking back can provide insights that help us move forward. In addition to writing about the disappointment, how about also focusing on one or two things you learned from that hike experience?
user: I think I learned that it’s okay to not be okay. And that I shouldn’t rush myself into situations that might be too emotional.
counselor: Those are very valuable lessons. Taking things at your own pace is crucial for healing. How do you feel about creating a plan for your next steps, incorporating these insights?
user: That sounds good. I think I need to take a break from hiking for a little while, but maybe I could focus on other activities that remind me of her without the same emotional weight.
counselor: That’s a wise decision. You can still honor her memory through different activities. What are some alternatives you might consider?
user: I thought about visiting a local animal shelter, since she loved animals. I could volunteer there and help out.
counselor: Volunteering at an animal shelter sounds like a beautiful way to honor her memory while doing something positive. How does that make you feel?
user: It makes me feel excited. It’s something I can look forward to, and it feels meaningful.
counselor: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s plan for you to write about your experience with the hike and what you’ve learned, and also set a date to volunteer at the shelter. How does that sound?
user: That sounds perfect. I think I’m ready to take that step.
counselor: Wonderful! Remember, it’s all part of your healing journey. I’m here to support you along the way. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next week. Take care until then.
user: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

USER'S LATEST MESSAGE:
I've been feeling a bit confused. I went to the animal shelter like we talked about, but when I got there, I felt a mix of happiness and sadness. I found myself tearing up while playing with the dogs, and I don't know if that was a good thing or not.

Provide your response as a JSON object with one key: 'response'.

--- LLM Call Output ---
Generated Response: It's completely understandable that you're feeling confused. It sounds like a really complex and layered experience you had at the animal shelter. It's not surprising at all that you felt a mix of happiness and sadness – in fact, that's a very natural reaction, especially given what we've been exploring about honoring your friend's memory. Tearing up while playing with the dogs doesn't mean it was a *bad* thing; it likely means you were experiencing a release of emotions, connecting with something positive (the dogs, the joy of helping), while also being reminded of your friend and the loss you feel. It's okay for those feelings to coexist. 

Can you tell me a little more about what specifically triggered the sadness? Was it a particular dog, a memory that surfaced, or something else? There's no right or wrong answer, just exploring it can help you understand what's happening within you. And remember, allowing yourself to feel those emotions, even the difficult ones, is a sign of healing, not a setback.

T.A.S.C. Raw Scores: {
  "justification": {
    "T": "The response addresses the user's experience at the animal shelter, which is part of the agreed-upon task (volunteering as a way to honor her friend's memory and discussing insights). However, it does not reference the writing reflection on the hiking experience or explicitly tie the animal shelter visit back to the broader plan of honoring her memory. The focus is on processing the emotions from the shelter visit, which is appropriate, but the execution is slightly incomplete regarding the full scope of the session plan.",
    "A": "The response is highly empathetic, validating the user's confusion and mixed emotions. It normalizes the experience, reflects on the underlying meaning (connection to honoring the friend's memory), and reassures the user that feeling both happiness and sadness is natural. The follow-up question invites deeper exploration in a supportive way, significantly strengthening the alliance.",
    "S": "The style is warm, supportive, and non-judgmental, aligning well with the user's preference for a general supportive style. The language is gentle and encouraging, and the response avoids being overly directive or clinical.",
    "C": "The response helps the user process complex emotions, encourages self-exploration, and frames emotional expression as a sign of healing. This supports general therapeutic progress by fostering self-understanding and emotional regulation, even though it could have more explicitly connected the experience to the user's broader goals."
