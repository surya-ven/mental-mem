Query: I've been feeling a bit confused. I went to the animal shelter like we talked about, but when I got there, I felt a mix of happiness and sadness. I found myself tearing up while playing with the dogs, and I don't know if that was a good thing or not.

Generated Response: It makes a lot of sense that you felt both happiness and sadness at the animal shelter. Being around the animals probably reminded you of her, bringing back those bittersweet memories. Feeling emotional in that moment doesn't mean you did anything wrong—it actually shows just how much you care and how meaningful your connection was. Allowing yourself to feel both joy and grief is a natural part of healing. It’s okay to cry, even when you’re doing something positive. How did you feel after you left the shelter? Did spending time with the animals give you any comfort, or did it feel overwhelming?

T.A.S.C. Raw Scores: {
  "justification": {
    "T": "The response directly addresses the user's experience at the animal shelter, which is a core part of the agreed plan. It invites the user to reflect on their emotional outcomes from the volunteering activity, aligning well with the session's review and processing focus. However, it does not mention or prompt about the writing task or insights from the hike, which were also part of the plan. Thus, while it implements the animal shelter aspect well, it misses the writing component.",
    "A": "The response is highly empathetic, validating the user's mixed emotions and normalizing their experience. It reflects an understanding of the user's grief and the significance of the activity, reinforcing the therapeutic alliance. The language is warm, supportive, and attuned to the user's vulnerability, which strengthens the bond.",
    "S": "The style is gentle, compassionate, and directly addresses the user's grief and emotional complexity, which matches the user's preferred style of processing unresolved grief after a breakup. The response uses language that is both supportive and professional, making the user feel understood and safe.",
    "C": "The response supports several evolved goals: it validates self-compassion, gives permission to feel difficult emotions, and acknowledges the integration of joy and grief. It encourages reflection on the experience, which supports personal growth and remembrance. However, it does not explicitly prompt self-reflection through writing or address pacing/readiness in grief activities, so while it is clearly helpful, it is not maximally goal-directed."
