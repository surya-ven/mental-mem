Query: I started the list and was pretty good about it for the first few days. But then something happened—I got a message from my ex out of nowhere. She just asked how I was doing. I ended up responding, and we talked a bit. After that, I felt like I ruined my progress, so I stopped writing things down for the rest of the week. I’m not sure if talking to her counts as moving forward or if I just set myself back.
