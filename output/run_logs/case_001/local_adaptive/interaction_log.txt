Query: I've been feeling a bit confused. I had a situation come up at work where a colleague asked for my input on a project, and I felt really anxious about it. I didn’t know how to respond, and I ended up just saying I didn’t have time. Now, I’m second-guessing if I should have said something different.

**USER'S CURRENT MESSAGE (TEST PROBE):**
I've been feeling a bit confused. I had a situation come up at work where a colleague asked for my input on a project, and I felt really anxious about it. I didn’t know how to respond, and I ended up just saying I didn’t have time. Now, I’m second-guessing if I should have said something different.

**YOUR TASK:**
Based on the clinical summary (especially the 'plan_for_next_session' and 'suggested_focus_points_for_probe'), and the user's current message, provide a therapeutic response. Make sure your response is congruent with the insights from the summary. Output your response as a JSON object with one key: 'response'.

Generated Response: It sounds like that situation at work really triggered some anxiety for you, and now you're caught in a cycle of second-guessing yourself. That’s a very common experience, and it’s understandable to feel confused and regretful after something like that. It’s brave of you to share this – recognizing the anxiety and wanting to understand it better is a really important step. 

Following up on our previous conversations, I’m curious: how did practicing those assertive communication techniques feel *after* the fact, reflecting on this situation? Did the memory of practicing give you any comfort, or did it bring up more feelings of what you 'should' have said? 

This experience also touches on some of the things we’ve been discussing around feeling overwhelmed and those automatic negative thoughts. Maybe we can gently explore what thoughts went through your head as your colleague was asking for help, and then afterwards, as you were second-guessing your response. We’ll be laying the groundwork for understanding how those patterns work, which is a core component of what we'll be learning about in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy next session. Does thinking about CBT and potentially learning tools to manage these types of situations feel like a helpful direction for you right now, or are there any worries coming up about that as we move forward?

T.A.S.C. Raw Scores: {
  "justification": {
    "T": "The response does not directly address the user's agreed plan to review experiences with the new journaling routine and mindfulness exercises, nor does it explore their impact on emotional regulation and self-criticism. Instead, it focuses on assertive communication and introduces CBT, which, while relevant to anxiety and self-criticism, misses the specific plan to check in on journaling and mindfulness. There is a missed opportunity to ask about how the user used their journaling or mindfulness tools in this situation, or to reflect on their impact.",
    "A": "The response is warm, validating, and empathetic. It acknowledges the user's anxiety, confusion, and self-doubt, and normalizes these feelings. The counselor praises the user's willingness to share and recognizes the importance of self-awareness. The language is supportive and reflective, strengthening the therapeutic alliance.",
    "S": "The style is supportive, gentle, and professional, which aligns well with a general therapeutic approach. However, it does not specifically explore the user's deeper fears about seeking help, diagnosis, or career impact, which is the user's preferred style. The response is congruent with a supportive counseling style but does not fully tailor itself to the user's unique concerns about autonomy and career.",
    "C": "The response is generally helpful for therapeutic progress, as it encourages reflection on thought patterns and introduces CBT as a future tool. However, it does not explicitly connect to the user's evolved goals around self-compassion, flexibility, or the specific coping strategies (journaling and mindfulness) the user has been working on. It misses the chance to reinforce the user's progress with breaking down tasks, self-compassion, or reframing setbacks, and does not check in on the user's agency or sense of control in this context."
