Query: It was kind of weird this week. I put the sticky note on my desk, and I saw it every morning. Some days I did something, like drank water, but a couple of times I just stared at the note and felt annoyed, like I was forcing myself and it didn’t mean anything. Once I even took the note down for a day because it made me feel guilty for not doing the thing. I know it's supposed to help, but what if it just starts feeling like pressure instead of encouragement?

I think it’s been this way for a long time, but it got worse after high school. I used to be better at keeping up with things, but now I just feel… heavy, like everything takes extra effort. There are days where I do better, but they don’t last. I try to set goals and make lists, but I usually don’t follow through.
I think I felt a little less tired on those days, or maybe just less… empty. I still didn’t feel super motivated, but it was like I had done at least one thing right. On the days I skipped, I kind of fell back into old habits.
Thank you for being so honest about that. Setbacks like this are actually a really normal part of making any kind of change, especially when life gets busy or stressful. I want to check in—when you realized you weren’t keeping up with your goals, what kinds of thoughts went through your mind?
