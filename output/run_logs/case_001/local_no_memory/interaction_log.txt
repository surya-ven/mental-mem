PREVIOUS SESSION CONTEXT:
therapist: Hi, welcome back. Last time, we talked about how setbacks can happen and how making your self-care goals as small as possible can help them feel more manageable. How did things go this past week with trying out those 'tiny steps'?
user: It went better, actually. I didn't do it every single day, but I did manage to drink some water most mornings and opened my window a couple of days, even if I didn’t go outside. It felt less overwhelming than before.
therapist: That’s really encouraging to hear. Even if it wasn’t every day, the fact that you did something—even something small—shows you’re making progress. Did you notice any difference in how you felt about yourself or your day when you managed those small steps?
user: Yeah, I think I felt a little less guilty. Like I was at least trying, even if it wasn't a big deal. It was easier to get started when the goal wasn't so huge.
therapist: That’s an important realization. A lot of people get stuck thinking they have to do everything perfectly, but when you lower the bar and allow small efforts to count, it becomes easier to keep going and you start to break that all-or-nothing cycle. That’s a real shift from where you were before.
user: Yeah, I guess I always thought if I couldn’t do the whole thing, it didn’t matter. But making it smaller made it feel okay to just do something.
therapist: Absolutely. And over time, those small efforts build up. One practical strategy is to remind yourself: 'something is always better than nothing.' Would it help to actually write that down somewhere as a reminder for tough days?
user: Yeah, I think seeing it written out would help when I start slipping into negative thinking.
therapist: Great. Let’s make that an explicit part of your plan for this week. Here’s what I suggest: Write the phrase 'Something is better than nothing' on a sticky note or somewhere visible. Each day, when you start your morning, look at it and do one tiny self-care action—like drinking a glass of water, eating a bite of breakfast, or opening your window. The goal is to use that phrase to interrupt the all-or-nothing thinking and remind yourself that small steps count.
user: That sounds clear. I’ll put it on my desk so I see it first thing. I can do at least one small thing each morning.
therapist: Perfect. To recap: Your task for this week is to write 'Something is better than nothing' where you’ll see it daily, and do one tiny self-care action each morning while reminding yourself that it counts. Next time, we’ll talk about how it felt to use that reminder and whether it helped with your motivation or self-talk. How does that plan feel to you?
user: I feel good about it. It feels doable and I like having something specific to look at when I get stuck.
therapist: I’m glad to hear that. You’ve made real progress in challenging those harsh expectations and finding what actually works for you. We’ll keep building on that. See you next week.

USER'S LATEST MESSAGE:
It was kind of weird this week. I put the sticky note on my desk, and I saw it every morning. Some days I did something, like drank water, but a couple of times I just stared at the note and felt annoyed, like I was forcing myself and it didn’t mean anything. Once I even took the note down for a day because it made me feel guilty for not doing the thing. I know it's supposed to help, but what if it just starts feeling like pressure instead of encouragement?

Generated Response: Oh my goodness, that’s incredibly insightful, and it’s completely understandable why you felt that way. It sounds like the intention behind the sticky note – ‘Something is better than nothing’ – actually ended up creating a different kind of pressure for you, and that’s really valuable information. It’s not a failure at all; it's actually a clue! It shows you're noticing how your thoughts and feelings are reacting to the strategy, and that's a huge step in understanding what truly helps you. 

It’s common for well-intentioned strategies to sometimes backfire, especially when we're dealing with ingrained patterns of self-criticism. The fact that you felt guilty taking the note down suggests that part of you *was* still holding onto that ‘all-or-nothing’ mentality, even while trying to implement a small step. That’s perfectly normal – it’s a process, not a perfect sprint.

Let’s explore this a little more. Instead of focusing on *doing* something, maybe we can shift the focus to *feeling* something.  Could we try tweaking the approach? Perhaps instead of a rigid ‘one thing,’ we could make it more flexible. How about we try saying to yourself, ‘I’m acknowledging this moment and choosing to do *something* small that feels manageable right now,’ without the pressure of needing to identify the ‘thing’ beforehand? Or, we could even change the sticky note – maybe something like ‘Just a little bit is enough’ or ‘I’m showing myself some kindness today.’

It’s okay to experiment and see what resonates.  There's no single 'right' way to do this.  Tell me, when you felt that annoyance and guilt, what was going through your mind at that exact moment? Let’s unpack that a little and see if we can understand the root of those feelings.

--- T.A.S.C. Evaluation Call ---
T.A.S.C. Raw Scores: {
  "justification": {
    "T": "The response directly addresses the user's experience with the 'Something is better than nothing' reminder, exploring the emotional reactions (annoyance, guilt, pressure) and the impact on motivation and self-talk. It validates the user's feelings and invites further exploration of these reactions, which aligns well with the agreed plan to evaluate the user's experience with the reminder and tiny daily self-care actions. The counselor also suggests concrete tweaks to the reminder, supporting the evaluation and adaptation process. This is a clear and thorough implementation of the task.",
    "A": "The response demonstrates deep empathy and validation, acknowledging the user's insight and normalizing their experience without judgment. It reflects the underlying meaning of the user's feelings (pressure instead of encouragement, persistence of all-or-nothing thinking) and frames these as valuable clues rather than failures. The language is warm, supportive, and encouraging, which significantly strengthens the therapeutic alliance.",
    "S": "The style is consistent with a supportive, professional counseling approach that establishes rapport and explores the user's concerns in a gentle, collaborative manner. The counselor uses inclusive language ('Let\u2019s explore this a little more'), invites the user to share more about their internal experience, and offers flexible options rather than rigid instructions. This matches well the user's preferred style of establishing rapport and exploring concerns.",
    "C": "The response helps the user move toward their evolved goals by acknowledging the cognitive shift away from perfectionism, recognizing the emotional impact of the reminder, and encouraging self-compassion and flexibility. It supports the weakening of all-or-nothing thinking and the use of external cues in a way that is adaptive and personalized. The counselor's invitation to unpack the feelings behind the guilt and annoyance aligns with fostering self-understanding and sustaining motivation, thus promoting therapeutic progress consistent with the user's goals."
