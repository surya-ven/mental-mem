--- Session 1 ---
counselor: Hi there! I’m really glad you decided to come in today. How are you feeling about this session?
user: I’m a bit anxious, honestly. I’ve been putting this off for a while.
counselor: That’s completely understandable. It’s a big step to seek help, especially when there are so many concerns weighing on your mind. Can you tell me a bit about what’s been bringing you here?
user: Well, a friend suggested I check with my doctor about possibly having major depressive disorder. But I’m really afraid of what that might mean for me.
counselor: It sounds like there are a lot of worries around the possible diagnosis. What specifically concerns you about being diagnosed with major depressive disorder?
user: I’m worried it’ll go on my records and affect my future, like my ability to become a counselor. I’ve been thinking about that career for a while.

User/Main Prompt Content (History part omitted from log for brevity if long):
You are an empathetic AI counselor. Based on the entire conversation history below, respond to the user's final message.

USER'S LATEST MESSAGE:
I've been feeling a bit confused. I had a situation come up at work where a colleague asked for my input on a project, and I felt really anxious about it. I didn’t know how to respond, and I ended up just saying I didn’t have time. Now, I’m second-guessing if I should have said something different....

Generated Response: Thank you for sharing how you’re feeling. It’s completely understandable to feel anxious in situations where you’re put on the spot, especially when you’re already carrying a lot emotionally. Work situations can be stressful, and it’s common to second-guess our responses afterward. What’s important to remember is that in that moment, you did what felt safest for you. That’s valid.

If you’d like, we can explore what made you feel anxious about responding, and whether there are ways to feel more comfortable in similar situations in the future. It might also help to consider what you would have liked to say, and to remind yourself that it’s okay to set boundaries or ask for time to think. Every interaction is a learning experience, not a test of your worth or competence.

How are you feeling now about the situation? Would you like to talk through what you might do if something similar comes up again?

T.A.S.C. Raw Scores: {
  "justification": {
    "T": "The response does not directly address the user's agreed plan to review experiences with the new journaling routine and mindfulness exercises, nor does it explore their impact on emotional regulation and self-criticism. Instead, it focuses on the immediate work situation and the user's anxiety and self-doubt. While the response is supportive and relevant to the user's emotional state, it misses the specific task of reviewing and adjusting the agreed-upon plan. There is no mention of journaling, mindfulness, or how these tools might relate to the current situation.",
    "A": "The response is warm, validating, and empathetic. It normalizes the user's anxiety, acknowledges the emotional load, and reframes the situation in a compassionate way. The counselor invites exploration and offers reassurance, which strengthens the therapeutic alliance. The language is specific to the user's experience and avoids platitudes.",
    "S": "The style is supportive, gentle, and professional, which aligns well with a general therapeutic approach. However, it does not explicitly engage with the user's deeper fears about seeking help, diagnosis, or autonomy, nor does it probe the underlying concerns about self-criticism or perfectionism. While the style is congruent with supportive counseling, it is not precisely tailored to the user's preferred style of exploring fears about help-seeking and autonomy.",
    "C": "The response is generally helpful and supportive, encouraging self-compassion and reframing the situation as a learning experience. However, it does not explicitly connect to the user's evolved goals around managing self-criticism, perfectionism, or using structured coping strategies like journaling and mindfulness. The response could be improved by linking the current situation to the user's ongoing work on self-compassion, flexibility, and emotional regulation, or by prompting reflection on how their new routines might help in similar moments."
