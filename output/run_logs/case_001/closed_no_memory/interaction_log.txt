therapist: Hi, it’s really good to meet you. I appreciate you taking the step to reach out and start this process. Before we get into things, I want you to know that our sessions are confidential, and you are in control of what you want to share and the pace you want to go at. How are you feeling about being here today?
user: I’m a little nervous, to be honest. I’ve never done therapy before. I mostly just want to figure things out, but I’m worried about what might happen if I go to a doctor or get diagnosed with something like depression.
therapist: It’s completely normal to feel nervous, especially when you’re considering something new and potentially life-changing. I hear that you’re worried about the consequences of getting a diagnosis, particularly about it going on your records and affecting your future plans, like becoming a counselor.

User/Main Prompt Content (History part omitted from log for brevity if long):
You are an empathetic AI counselor. Based on the entire conversation history below, respond to the user's final message.

USER'S LATEST MESSAGE:
It was kind of weird this week. I put the sticky note on my desk, and I saw it every morning. Some days I did something, like drank water, but a couple of times I just stared at the note and felt annoyed, like I was forcing myself and it didn’t mean anything. Once I even took the note down for a day because it made me feel guilty for not doing the thing. I know it's supposed to help, but what if it just starts feeling like pressure instead of encouragement?...

--- LLM Call Output ---
Generated Response: Thank you for being so honest about how the sticky note affected you this week. It makes a lot of sense that something meant to encourage you could sometimes feel like pressure or a reminder of what you didn’t do. That feeling of guilt shows how hard you’re being on yourself, and it’s okay to notice that without judging yourself for it. This is important information about what works for you and what doesn’t. Maybe instead of a visible note every morning, you could try something gentler—like a reminder you look at only when you feel motivated, or even a different phrase that feels kinder to you. The goal isn’t to create pressure but to offer support in a way that feels manageable. How do you feel about experimenting with adjusting the reminder or even taking breaks from it when it feels too much? We can find a way that feels right for you.
