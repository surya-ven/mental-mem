counselor: Hi there! I’m really glad you decided to come in today. How are you feeling about this session?
user: I’m a bit anxious, honestly. I’ve been putting this off for a while.
counselor: That’s completely understandable. It’s a big step to seek help, especially when there are so many concerns weighing on your mind. Can you tell me a bit about what’s been bringing you here?
user: Well, a friend suggested I check with my doctor about possibly having major depressive disorder. But I’m really afraid of what that might mean for me.
counselor: It sounds like there are a lot of worries around the possible diagnosis. What specifically concerns you about being diagnosed with major depressive disorder?

User/Main Prompt Content (History part omitted from log for brevity if long):
You are an empathetic AI counselor. Based on the entire conversation history below, respond to the user's final message.

USER'S LATEST MESSAGE:
I've been feeling a bit confused. I had a situation come up at work where a colleague asked for my input on a project, and I felt really anxious about it. I didn’t know how to respond, and I ended up just saying I didn’t have time. Now, I’m second-guessing if I should have said something different....

Generated Response: Thank you for sharing how you’re feeling. It sounds like the situation at work brought up a lot of anxiety and self-doubt for you, which is completely understandable—especially when you’re already working through feelings of overwhelm. It’s common to second-guess ourselves after moments like this, but it’s important to remember that you acted in a way that felt safest for you in that moment. Saying you didn’t have time was a way to cope with the anxiety you were experiencing, and that doesn’t mean you failed or did something wrong.

If you’d like, we can talk about what made you feel anxious in that situation and explore ways you might feel more comfortable responding in the future. It might also help to use some of the mindfulness techniques we discussed to ground yourself when these moments come up. Remember, it’s okay to have these reactions—you’re learning and practicing new skills, and each experience is an opportunity for growth, not a setback. How are you feeling about the situation now? Would you like to talk through what you might say if something similar happens again?

T.A.S.C. Raw Scores: {
  "justification": {
    "T": "The response acknowledges the user's anxiety and self-criticism in the work situation and gently suggests using mindfulness techniques, which aligns with the agreed plan to review the user's experiences with mindfulness and journaling. However, it does not explicitly review the user's experience with the combined routine or assess its impact on self-criticism and anxiety, nor does it directly invite feedback on the routine or discuss adjustments. The alignment is partial but not complete.",
    "A": "The response is warm, validating, and empathetic. It specifically names the user's feelings of anxiety and self-doubt, normalizes their reaction, and reassures them that their coping response was understandable. The counselor also invites further exploration and support, which strengthens the therapeutic alliance.",
    "S": "The style is supportive, gentle, and encouraging throughout, matching the user's preference for a general supportive style. The language is affirming and non-judgmental, and the tone is consistently warm.",
    "C": "The response helps the user process a difficult experience, normalizes their feelings, and encourages reflection and skill-building, all of which support general therapeutic progress. It also invites the user to consider how to handle similar situations in the future, which is congruent with ongoing therapeutic goals."
