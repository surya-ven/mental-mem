Query: It was kind of weird this week. I put the sticky note on my desk, and I saw it every morning. Some days I did something, like drank water, but a couple of times I just stared at the note and felt annoyed, like I was forcing myself and it didn’t mean anything. Once I even took the note down for a day because it made me feel guilty for not doing the thing. I know it's supposed to help, but what if it just starts feeling like pressure instead of encouragement?

Generated Response: Thank you for sharing how the sticky note felt for you this week. It sounds like it brought up some mixed feelings—some motivation, but also annoyance and even guilt at times. That’s a very understandable reaction, especially when trying new ways to support yourself. I’m curious, when you felt annoyed or pressured by the note, what was going through your mind? And how did those feelings affect your day? Exploring these daily emotional experiences can help us better understand what works for you and what might feel like too much pressure. We can also keep in mind your concerns about feeling forced versus encouraged, and find approaches that feel manageable and respectful of your pace and boundaries.

T.A.S.C. Raw Scores: {
  "justification": {
    "T": "The response directly addresses the user's experience with the sticky note reminder, which is the core of the agreed plan. It explores the user's mixed feelings about the reminder, including motivation, annoyance, and guilt, and invites further reflection on thoughts and emotional impact. This aligns well with evaluating the user's experience with the reminder and its effects on motivation, self-talk, and emotional responses to setbacks. The counselor also acknowledges the user's concerns about pressure versus encouragement and suggests collaboratively finding manageable approaches, which fits the task well.",
    "A": "The response demonstrates clear empathy by validating the user's mixed feelings and normalizing their reactions as understandable when trying new self-support strategies. It reflects the user's emotional experience with specificity (motivation, annoyance, guilt) rather than generic platitudes. The counselor's curiosity and invitation to explore the user's thoughts and feelings further strengthen the alliance by showing genuine interest and respect for the user's experience.",
    "S": "The language is supportive, professional, and conversational, matching the user's preferred style of establishing rapport and exploring concerns. The counselor uses gentle, open-ended questions and acknowledges the user's feelings without judgment, which fits well with a therapeutic style focused on collaboration and respect for the user's pace and boundaries. The tone is warm and inviting, consistent with the user's preference for rapport and exploration.",
    "C": "The response helps the user move toward their evolved goals by encouraging exploration of emotional responses to the reminder, which can illuminate patterns of all-or-nothing thinking and negative self-talk. It acknowledges the user's concerns about pressure and supports finding manageable, respectful approaches, which aligns with developing self-compassion and realistic goal-setting. By inviting reflection on how feelings affect the day, it supports ongoing negotiation of motivation and self-care amid fluctuating internal states. Thus, it clearly supports progress toward the user's goals."
