Query: I've been feeling a bit confused. I had a situation come up at work where a colleague asked for my input on a project, and I felt really anxious about it. I didn’t know how to respond, and I ended up just saying I didn’t have time. Now, I’m second-guessing if I should have said something different.

I've been feeling a bit confused. I had a situation come up at work where a colleague asked for my input on a project, and I felt really anxious about it. I didn’t know how to respond, and I ended up just saying I didn’t have time. Now, I’m second-guessing if I should have said something different.

Generated Response: Thank you for sharing this experience—it’s understandable to feel confused and anxious in situations where you’re asked for input, especially if you’re already working on asserting yourself and managing overwhelming emotions. It sounds like you felt pressured in the moment and chose to protect yourself by saying you didn't have time. It’s completely normal to second-guess these interactions, especially when you’re striving for more confidence and clarity in communication, both with your doctor and in other areas of life.

Reflecting on this, I’m curious how you felt immediately after the interaction, and whether any of the assertive communication techniques we discussed previously came to mind, even if it was after the fact. It can be helpful to notice these moments—not to judge yourself, but to identify opportunities for practicing new responses in the future. 

This also connects well with the principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which we planned to start exploring together. CBT offers practical tools for managing anxious thoughts and feelings of overwhelm, and for approaching situations like this with more confidence and emotional control. Would you be open to discussing how some CBT strategies might help you prepare for or reflect on these types of interactions? And as we move forward, are there specific expectations or hopes you have for what you’d like to get out of CBT, especially when it comes to work or social situations?

Lastly, I want to validate your desire for autonomy—whether in healthcare or at work, it’s important to feel heard and empowered in your decisions. Let’s continue building on the assertiveness and self-advocacy skills you’ve been developing, and tailor our approach to your unique needs and goals.

T.A.S.C. Raw Scores: {
  "justification": {
    "T": "The response does not directly address the user's agreed plan to review experiences with the new journaling routine and mindfulness exercises, nor does it explore their impact on emotional regulation and self-criticism. Instead, it focuses on a recent work interaction and introduces CBT as a new topic. While it attempts to connect to emotional regulation and self-criticism in a general sense, it misses the specific review and adjustment of the journaling/mindfulness plan. Thus, the alignment with the explicit session task is incomplete.",
    "A": "The response is warm, validating, and empathetic. It acknowledges the user's confusion and anxiety, normalizes second-guessing, and highlights the user's desire for autonomy and self-advocacy. The counselor reflects the user's underlying needs for agency and emotional control, which strengthens the therapeutic alliance.",
    "S": "The style is supportive, professional, and sensitive to the user's concerns about autonomy and agency. The language is gentle and validating, and the response references the user's desire for empowerment in both healthcare and work contexts, which aligns well with the user's preferred style.",
    "C": "The response is generally helpful and supportive of the user's broader goals (e.g., agency, emotional control, self-compassion, and assertiveness). However, it does not explicitly connect to the user's specific goals around journaling, mindfulness, or managing perfectionism and self-criticism in the context of those habits. The introduction of CBT is potentially helpful but not directly tied to the user's articulated goals or the agreed plan. Thus, the connection to the evolved goals is present but not explicit or masterful."
