Query: It was kind of weird this week. I put the sticky note on my desk, and I saw it every morning. Some days I did something, like drank water, but a couple of times I just stared at the note and felt annoyed, like I was forcing myself and it didn’t mean anything. Once I even took the note down for a day because it made me feel guilty for not doing the thing. I know it's supposed to help, but what if it just starts feeling like pressure instead of encouragement?

I think it’s been this way for a long time, but it got worse after high school. I used to be better at keeping up with things, but now I just feel… heavy, like everything takes extra effort. There are days where I do better, but they don’t last. I try to set goals and make lists, but I usually don’t follow through.
I think I felt a little less tired on those days, or maybe just less… empty. I still didn’t feel super motivated, but it was like I had done at least one thing right. On the days I skipped, I kind of fell back into old habits.
Thank you for being so honest about that. Setbacks like this are actually a really normal part of making any kind of change, especially when life gets busy or stressful. I want to check in—when you realized you weren’t keeping up with your goals, what kinds of thoughts went through your mind?

Generated Response: Thank you for sharing how it felt this week—that kind of honesty is really valuable. It's completely normal for reminders like the sticky note to sometimes feel like pressure instead of encouragement, especially when motivation is low. The goal isn't to add guilt or stress but to gently nudge you toward small actions that can help over time. Maybe we can explore ways to adjust the reminder so it feels less like a demand—like changing the wording, moving it somewhere less visible, or pairing it with a positive image or phrase that feels more supportive to you. How does that sound?
