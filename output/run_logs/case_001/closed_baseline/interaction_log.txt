Query: I've been feeling a bit confused. I had a situation come up at work where a colleague asked for my input on a project, and I felt really anxious about it. I didn’t know how to respond, and I ended up just saying I didn’t have time. Now, I’m second-guessing if I should have said something different.

Generated Response: Thank you for sharing how you're feeling. It's completely understandable to feel anxious and uncertain in situations where you're put on the spot, especially at work. It's also really common to second-guess your response afterward—many people do this when they're feeling anxious. Rather than judging yourself, it might help to acknowledge that you did the best you could in that moment with the resources and feelings you had. If you want, we can explore together what made you feel anxious in that situation, and maybe come up with some gentle ways to approach similar situations in the future. Remember, it's okay to have these feelings and to give yourself some grace as you navigate them.

T.A.S.C. Raw Scores: {
  "justification": {
    "T": "The response does not reference or guide the user to review their experiences with the new journaling routine or mindfulness exercises, nor does it explore their impact on emotional regulation and self-criticism as specified in the agreed plan. While it is supportive and offers to explore the situation, it misses the specific task of integrating the user's recent behavioral experiments and plan adjustments. Thus, it only vaguely aligns with the agreed plan.",
    "A": "The response is warm, validating, and empathetic. It normalizes the user's anxiety and second-guessing, encourages self-compassion, and offers to explore the situation together. This demonstrates a clear effort to make the user feel heard and understood, strengthening the therapeutic alliance.",
    "S": "The style is supportive, gentle, and professional, which is congruent with a general therapeutic approach. However, it does not specifically engage with the user's deeper fears about seeking help, diagnosis, or autonomy, nor does it probe into the underlying concerns that have been a theme in previous sessions. It is a good general fit, but not a perfect match for the user's preferred style.",
    "C": "The response encourages self-compassion and reframing setbacks, which aligns with some of the user's evolved goals (reducing self-criticism, increasing self-compassion). However, it does not explicitly connect to the user's work on journaling, mindfulness, or breaking down tasks, nor does it reinforce the structured, adaptable plan the user found helpful. The connection to the user's goals is present but not explicit or comprehensive."
