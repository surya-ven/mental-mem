It's brave of you to share that, and recognizing the anxiety is a really important first step. \n\nWe talked a little about mindfulness last session as an alternative to thought journaling, and given how overwhelmed you felt in this situation, it feels like a good place to start our conversation today. Could you tell me a bit about what you understand about mindfulness, or perhaps if you\u2019ve ever tried any mindfulness exercises before? Even just a little bit of experience, or even just your thoughts about it, would be helpful. Let's explore what your experience has been, and see if it might offer a way to gently navigate those anxious thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in the 'what ifs.' We can then discuss whether it feels like a good fit for you, and if so, how we might integrate it more consistently. How does that sound?",

A situation arose, it triggered anxiety, and now you're caught in a cycle of second-guessing.\n\nIt's brave of you to acknowledge this and to share it. Let's unpack this a little. You chose to say you didn't have time, and while that might not have been the 'ideal' response in your mind, it *was* a response. It was a way you managed the situation in that moment. Often, when anxiety kicks in, our responses aren\u2019t about what we *think* we should have said, but about what felt safest and most manageable *at that time*.\n\nRemember what we discussed about self-compassion? Could you try offering yourself some kindness right now? Perhaps something like, 'It's okay that I felt anxious and didn't know what to say. I did the best I could in that moment.' We can explore the thoughts and feelings behind this situation further if you'd like, and maybe even consider what a more helpful response *might* look like in a similar situation in the future, but let\u2019s start with acknowledging the discomfort and being gentle with yourself.

Tears can be a sign that you\u2019re processing your feelings, and it\u2019s okay to experience both joy and sorrow at the same time. Allowing yourself to feel both emotions is a healthy part of healing, even if it feels confusing. How did it feel to be with the animals overall, and is there anything you noticed about the moments that brought you comfort or sadness?",

It invites further reflection on the experience, aligning well with the task to discuss insights in the session.

It\u2019s very normal to experience a mix of emotions\u2014happiness from doing something meaningful and sadness because it\u2019s connected to your memories of her. Tears can be a healthy way for your body to release feelings, especially when you\u2019re honoring someone important to you. Feeling both happy and sad at the same time doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing anything wrong; it actually shows how deeply you care and how much this experience means to you. These moments can be part of your healing, even if they feel confusing. If you\u2019re comfortable, we can talk more about what came up for you at the shelter and how you\u2019d like to process these mixed emotions. Remember, it\u2019s okay to have complicated feelings, and I\u2019m here to support you through them.",
