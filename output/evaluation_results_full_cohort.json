That feeling of anxiety when faced with a request, and then the regret about how you responded \u2013 that\u2019s a really tough spot to be in. It\u2019s brave of you to share that. \n\nRemember we talked about exploring self-help strategies as a starting point? Let's focus on that a little. One thing that often helps with these kinds of situations is practicing mindful self-compassion. When you find yourself replaying the scenario and feeling anxious, try pausing and noticing those feelings without judgment. Then, gently remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes, and it's okay to not have all the answers. You can even try saying something kind to yourself, like, 'It's okay, I did the best I could in that moment.'\n\nFor our next session, I'd like you to try a small exercise. Think about one specific, small step you could take to address this feeling of regret \u2013 it doesn't have to be a big confrontation or apology. Perhaps just acknowledging to yourself that you felt overwhelmed, or even just a brief, internal statement of self-forgiveness. Then, we can talk about how that felt when we meet again. How does that sound as a starting point, and does that feel manageable for you before our next session?",

You mentioned feeling overwhelmed by your thoughts before, and this situation seems to be triggering that again. It takes courage to acknowledge these feelings, especially when you're second-guessing yourself. \n\nLet's unpack this a little. You felt anxious when your colleague asked for your input, and your immediate response was to say you didn't have time. That's a very common reaction when feeling overwhelmed. It's a way to protect yourself from feeling further stressed. Now, you're wondering if you should have responded differently. That's the second-guessing kicking in.\n\nRemember how we talked about self-compassion? Can you offer yourself a little kindness right now? It's easy to fall into the trap of 'should haves,' but often, in the moment, we're doing the best we can with what we're feeling. \n\nPerhaps we can explore a few things. First, what specifically are you second-guessing about your response? What do you think you *should* have said? And more importantly, what feelings are coming up as you think about this situation? Just noticing those feelings, without judgment, can be a really helpful first step. We can also look at this through a CBT lens \u2013 are there any automatic negative thoughts contributing to this regret?
