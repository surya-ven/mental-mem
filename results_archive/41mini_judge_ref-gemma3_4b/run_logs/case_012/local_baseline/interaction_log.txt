Mem0 RAG Search: UserID='case_012_baseline_local', Query='I did try to use the phrase when I noticed the guilt coming up, and sometimes it helped me pause and not spiral right away. But there was a situation this week that left me feeling a bit stuck. A friend made a casual comment about someone 'changing teams,' and it brought up a lot of doubt and discomfort for me. I wanted to use the kindness practice, but I wasn’t sure if it was enough, or even the right thing—I just felt unsettled and kept questioning whether I was overreacting or if I should have said something. It made me wonder if being kind to myself in those moments really addresses the uncertainty, or if I’m just trying to ignore it.'

Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
I think that sounds doable. I like the idea of having a phrase to come back to—something to remind me that it’s okay to be in this in-between state for now. I’ll try to notice when the doubt or guilt comes up and just pause for a moment, instead of jumping straight into criticizing myself.
That’s an important realization: you have ways of finding steadiness, even if they’re small or temporary. Reaching for perspective—through others’ stories or the knowledge that identity is often more complex than we’re taught—can help loosen the grip of self-doubt and isolation. And your routines, like walking and time with your kids, remind you that there are still solid, meaningful parts of your life, even as your understanding of yourself shifts.

As we look back over the past weeks, it seems you’re learning to hold both the discomfort of not knowing and the beginnings of self-compassion. You’re allowing yourself to grieve and to question, but you’re also starting to notice that change doesn’t erase who you’ve been; it adds to your story.

For our next session, could we agree together on a small intention or practice? Perhaps, whenever you notice guilt or doubt, you might try offering yourself a brief moment of kindness—maybe a phrase like, “It’s okay to not have all the answers right now,” or a gentle reminder that you’re doing the best you can. How does that feel to you as an intention for the week?
I'm really glad you shared this with me. Setbacks can feel discouraging, especially when it seems like old doubts and guilt are just as strong as ever. It sounds like you’re wrestling with some deep questions about identity and self-trust—wondering how things could change so dramatically after so many years, and whether these new feelings are genuine.

It’s understandable that this feels confusing and even destabilizing. After decades of knowing yourself in one way, it makes sense that sudden change would bring uncertainty and self-questioning. In this moment, I wonder what it’s like to sit with that doubt and exhaustion, rather than trying to fight it or reason it away. Are there any thoughts or feelings that come up if you simply allow yourself to acknowledge how hard this is right now?

You also mentioned feeling as if you might be “fooling yourself” or “doing something wrong.” I’m curious what those thoughts feel like—do they connect to any particular memories, beliefs, or fears from your past? Or do they feel more like a reaction to how sudden and surprising this experience has been?

If it feels okay, we can take things slowly and just notice what comes up for you, without needing to have all the answers right now.
The guilty part feels heavy and tense, like I’m waiting for something bad to happen. It’s a lot of self-criticism, like, “You should have known yourself better,” or “You’re letting people down.” The curious part feels lighter. When I think about the encounters themselves, or just admitting the attraction to myself, it feels like relief, like taking off a mask I didn’t know I was wearing. But then the guilt comes back and it’s hard to stay in that lighter space for long.
That’s such a gentle insight—you’re recognizing that the part of you feeling guilty is longing for reassurance and understanding, not punishment or shame. And your relieved, curious part wants you to hold onto that sense of authenticity and freedom, even if it’s fleeting. 

It sounds like these parts aren’t trying to hurt you, but rather to keep you safe in different ways: one by protecting your sense of continuity and responsibility, the other by inviting you to explore and accept who you are now. When you reflect on this, does it shift your perspective at all on how you can move forward? Or do you notice any feelings of compassion for yourself in this process?

I think that sounds doable. I like the idea of having a phrase to come back to—something to remind me that it’s okay to be in this in-between state for now. I’ll try to notice when the doubt or guilt comes up and just pause for a moment, instead of jumping straight into criticizing myself.

Initial Model Output: It sounds like you’ve been putting in a really good effort with the intention, and that’s fantastic. It’s completely understandable that a comment from a friend, even a seemingly casual one, could trigger a flood of those familiar doubts and unsettle you. It’s brave of you to try and use the kindness practice, and it’s okay that it wasn’t enough this time – it’s a skill that takes practice, and sometimes it just doesn’t quite land. 

You’re right to question whether it’s about ignoring the uncertainty or addressing it. It’s not about ignoring it at all. It’s about learning to *hold* it, to acknowledge its presence without letting it completely consume you. It’s like feeling a wave – you don’t try to stop the wave, you learn to ride it, to navigate through it. 

That feeling of being unsettled and questioning whether you’re overreacting… that’s a really common response when you’re grappling with such a fundamental shift. It’s your mind trying to find a familiar framework to understand something completely new. 

Let’s gently explore that feeling of “should have said something.” Where does that thought come from? Is it about protecting your friend, or about a need to control the narrative of your own experience?  Just noticing where that feeling originates can sometimes create a little space between you and it. 

Would you like to talk a little more about what that comment brought up for you, or perhaps we could revisit the idea of what "enough" kindness looks like in these moments?

T.A.S.C.S. Raw Scores from Judge: {
  "justification": {
    "T": "The response clearly implements the agreed plan by acknowledging the user's effort to practice pausing and using kindness phrases, validating that sometimes the practice may not fully resolve feelings, and gently inviting further reflection. It stays true to the plan's spirit of noticing and reflecting on the experience of guilt and doubt, without contradicting or ignoring it.",
    "A": "The response demonstrates deep empathy by validating the user's feelings of doubt, discomfort, and unsettledness, recognizing the bravery in trying the kindness practice, and normalizing the experience of questioning oneself. It also reflects understanding of the underlying difficulty of grappling with uncertainty and change, which strengthens the therapeutic alliance.",
    "S": "The style is consistently reflective, using metaphor (wave riding), open-ended gentle questions, and invitations to explore feelings and thoughts. The language is thoughtful, calm, and encourages introspection, aligning well with the user's preferred reflective style.",
    "C": "The response connects well to the user's evolved goals by addressing the feelings of doubt and guilt linked to identity and change. It acknowledges the difficulty of fundamental shifts and invites exploration of internal narratives, which supports the user's insight about old beliefs and anchoring routines. It also subtly encourages the user to integrate change into their story rather than resist it.",
