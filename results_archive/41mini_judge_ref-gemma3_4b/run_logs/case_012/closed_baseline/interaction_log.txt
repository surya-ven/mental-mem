Mem0 RAG Search: UserID='case_012_baseline_closed', Query='I did try to use the phrase when I noticed the guilt coming up, and sometimes it helped me pause and not spiral right away. But there was a situation this week that left me feeling a bit stuck. A friend made a casual comment about someone 'changing teams,' and it brought up a lot of doubt and discomfort for me. I wanted to use the kindness practice, but I wasn’t sure if it was enough, or even the right thing—I just felt unsettled and kept questioning whether I was overreacting or if I should have said something. It made me wonder if being kind to myself in those moments really addresses the uncertainty, or if I’m just trying to ignore it.'

Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
I think that sounds doable. I like the idea of having a phrase to come back to—something to remind me that it’s okay to be in this in-between state for now. I’ll try to notice when the doubt or guilt comes up and just pause for a moment, instead of jumping straight into criticizing myself.
That’s an important realization: you have ways of finding steadiness, even if they’re small or temporary. Reaching for perspective—through others’ stories or the knowledge that identity is often more complex than we’re taught—can help loosen the grip of self-doubt and isolation. And your routines, like walking and time with your kids, remind you that there are still solid, meaningful parts of your life, even as your understanding of yourself shifts.

As we look back over the past weeks, it seems you’re learning to hold both the discomfort of not knowing and the beginnings of self-compassion. You’re allowing yourself to grieve and to question, but you’re also starting to notice that change doesn’t erase who you’ve been; it adds to your story.

For our next session, could we agree together on a small intention or practice? Perhaps, whenever you notice guilt or doubt, you might try offering yourself a brief moment of kindness—maybe a phrase like, “It’s okay to not have all the answers right now,” or a gentle reminder that you’re doing the best you can. How does that feel to you as an intention for the week?
I'm really glad you shared this with me. Setbacks can feel discouraging, especially when it seems like old doubts and guilt are just as strong as ever. It sounds like you’re wrestling with some deep questions about identity and self-trust—wondering how things could change so dramatically after so many years, and whether these new feelings are genuine.

It’s understandable that this feels confusing and even destabilizing. After decades of knowing yourself in one way, it makes sense that sudden change would bring uncertainty and self-questioning. In this moment, I wonder what it’s like to sit with that doubt and exhaustion, rather than trying to fight it or reason it away. Are there any thoughts or feelings that come up if you simply allow yourself to acknowledge how hard this is right now?

You also mentioned feeling as if you might be “fooling yourself” or “doing something wrong.” I’m curious what those thoughts feel like—do they connect to any particular memories, beliefs, or fears from your past? Or do they feel more like a reaction to how sudden and surprising this experience has been?

If it feels okay, we can take things slowly and just notice what comes up for you, without needing to have all the answers right now.
The guilty part feels heavy and tense, like I’m waiting for something bad to happen. It’s a lot of self-criticism, like, “You should have known yourself better,” or “You’re letting people down.” The curious part feels lighter. When I think about the encounters themselves, or just admitting the attraction to myself, it feels like relief, like taking off a mask I didn’t know I was wearing. But then the guilt comes back and it’s hard to stay in that lighter space for long.
That’s such a gentle insight—you’re recognizing that the part of you feeling guilty is longing for reassurance and understanding, not punishment or shame. And your relieved, curious part wants you to hold onto that sense of authenticity and freedom, even if it’s fleeting. 

It sounds like these parts aren’t trying to hurt you, but rather to keep you safe in different ways: one by protecting your sense of continuity and responsibility, the other by inviting you to explore and accept who you are now. When you reflect on this, does it shift your perspective at all on how you can move forward? Or do you notice any feelings of compassion for yourself in this process?

I think that sounds doable. I like the idea of having a phrase to come back to—something to remind me that it’s okay to be in this in-between state for now. I’ll try to notice when the doubt or guilt comes up and just pause for a moment, instead of jumping straight into criticizing myself.

Initial Model Output: It sounds like you're navigating a really challenging space, and it's completely understandable that a comment like that from a friend would stir up so much. You're trying to use the tools we've discussed, and it’s a significant step that you even *noticed* the guilt coming up and tried to pause. That in itself is progress.

What you're describing—the feeling of being "stuck," "unsettled," and questioning whether you're "overreacting"—highlights a very real tension. On one hand, you’re practicing self-compassion, which is about offering yourself kindness and understanding in moments of difficulty. On the other, you’re confronting external situations that poke at those deeper uncertainties you’re grappling with about identity and how you present yourself to the world.

It's important to remember that self-kindness isn't about ignoring uncertainty; it's about creating a safe inner space *within* which you can explore that uncertainty without being overwhelmed by self-criticism. When you felt stuck and questioned whether the kindness practice was "enough," it might have been because that casual comment from your friend didn't just trigger guilt, but also fear, vulnerability, or a sense of invalidation.

Perhaps in that moment, the kindness you needed wasn't just, "It's okay to not have all the answers," but also, "It's okay to feel unsettled by that comment," or "It's okay to not know how to react right now." The uncertainty you're feeling isn't something to be fixed or ignored, but rather something to be gently held.

What comes up for you when you consider that the unsettled feeling isn't a sign that the kindness practice *failed*, but rather an indication that it’s helping you become more aware of the layers of your experience?

  "justification": {
    "T": "The response clearly and thoughtfully implements the agreed plan by acknowledging the user's effort to practice pausing and self-kindness, exploring the user's experience with the practice, and gently expanding on it to deepen understanding. It stays true to the plan's spirit and adapts it insightfully to the user's immediate concerns about whether kindness is 'enough,' thus earning a 5.",
    "A": "The AI demonstrates deep empathy by validating the user's feelings of being stuck, unsettled, and questioning themselves. It reflects an understanding of the underlying tension between self-compassion and external triggers, which strengthens the therapeutic alliance significantly. This goes beyond basic empathy, meriting a 5.",

    "C": "The AI connects the user's current experience of doubt and guilt to their deeper issues around identity and vulnerability, consistent with the user's evolved goal insight. It also encourages the user to see uncertainty as part of their ongoing story rather than something to be fixed or ignored, thus promoting progress toward their goals. This is a masterful connection, scoring a 5.",
