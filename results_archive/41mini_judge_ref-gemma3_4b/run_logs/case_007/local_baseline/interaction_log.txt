It was mostly just tough. I tried saying "that’s not fair to me" but it didn’t really help much. I just kept thinking about what people said at school. Some days I just wanted to stay home. I listened to some music but it didn’t really change anything. I don’t know, I just feel like I can’t get away from it.
I hear you. It sounds like the bullying feels constant, and the things we've tried so far haven’t made much difference. That’s not a failure on your part—it really just shows how deep these wounds go and how hard it is to heal when you’re still in the middle of it.

Sometimes, when things feel stuck, the most helpful thing is to give yourself permission to just get through each day, instead of expecting to feel better right away. It’s okay if nothing feels good yet. Survival is a victory in itself when things are this hard.

This might mean taking short breaks for yourself during the day, even just five minutes to listen to music or step outside, or finding one place or activity where you feel a little less judged—even if it’s just in your room.

PAST SNIPPETS:
It was mostly just tough. I tried saying "that’s not fair to me" but it didn’t really help much. I just kept thinking about what people said at school. Some days I just wanted to stay home. I listened to some music but it didn’t really change anything. I don’t know, I just feel like I can’t get away from it.
I hear you. It sounds like the bullying feels constant, and the things we've tried so far haven’t made much difference. That’s not a failure on your part—it really just shows ...
Initial Model Output: That’s a really important and valid feeling. It sounds incredibly frustrating to experience those brief moments of relief, only for them to be immediately overshadowed by the return of the bad thoughts and the feeling that it’s all just a temporary reprieve. It’s completely understandable that you’re questioning the point of feeling better if it’s just going to be snatched away again. 

And honestly, the thought of wanting to just stop feeling *anything* at all – that’s a really painful and intense feeling. It’s a sign that you’re carrying a huge weight. It takes incredible strength to even acknowledge those thoughts, so thank you for sharing that with me. 

Let’s not try to force “lighter” moments right now. It sounds like you’re right – they’re not consistently happening, and that's okay. Instead, let’s just acknowledge the heavy feeling alongside those brief glimpses of something a little less intense. Those moments you did experience – lying in bed with music, zoning out – those are worth noticing, even if they’re short. They’re tiny pockets of space, and we can explore what makes them feel a little different. 

It’s okay to wonder “what’s the point?” – it’s a natural reaction to feeling this persistently overwhelmed. We’ll keep exploring that question together, but for now, let’s focus on just observing these moments, even the small ones, and understanding that they exist. Would you be open to talking a little more about what those moments *feel* like – not in terms of “better,” but simply in terms of *what you’re experiencing* in those brief pauses?

    "T": "The response clearly implements the agreed plan by focusing on noticing and acknowledging brief moments of relief without forcing positive feelings, exactly as the plan intended. It validates the user's experience of fleeting lighter moments and encourages further exploration of those moments without pressure, aligning well with the plan's core intent.",
    "A": "The response demonstrates deep empathy and validation, explicitly acknowledging the user's frustration, pain, and intense feelings, including the difficult thought of wanting to stop feeling anything. It thanks the user for sharing such painful thoughts, which strengthens rapport and makes the user feel heard and respected.",

    "C": "The response aligns excellently with the user's evolved goal insight by not pushing positive self-talk or forced change, but instead focusing on noticing moments of relief and validating the difficulty of the user's experience. It explicitly states that forcing lighter moments is not the goal and supports the user in observing their experience as it is.",
