Context (Session 5 Transcript):
counselor: Thanks for sticking with this and being honest, even though things have been rough. Directly: setbacks don’t erase your progress. You’re facing strong urges, but you’re still here and still trying changes, even if they feel small or uncomfortable. That’s important.

Let’s break down what happened since we last talked. Were you able to get your phone across the room, use cold water or another tool for the urges, or try that small social step at school? What felt a little easier (if any...

  "text_analyzed": "So I kept my phone away most nights, but one night I needed it for an alarm because I had to get up extra early. I ended up scrolling again that night because it was right next to me. I used cold water twice this week when I felt on edge, and it helped a bit, but one time I was at a friend’s house and didn’t know what to do because I didn’t want to explain why I was suddenly going to the bathroom just to use cold water. Also, I tried talking to another person at school, but it was in a group and I barely said anything. I wrote this down but I’m not sure if it “counts” or if I’m doing it right.",

PREVIOUS SESSION CONTEXT:
counselor: Thanks for sticking with this and being honest, even though things have been rough. Directly: setbacks don’t erase your progress. You’re facing strong urges, but you’re still here and still trying changes, even if they feel small or uncomfortable. That’s important.

Initial Model Output: Okay, let’s unpack this. It sounds like you had a really challenging night with your phone, and it’s completely understandable that you slipped up – needing an alarm is a legitimate need! Don’t beat yourself up about that one instance; it’s a real-life complication, and it doesn’t invalidate all the progress you *did* make.

The situation with the cold water at your friend’s house is tricky. It’s smart to recognize that having to explain yourself disrupts your strategy. That’s valuable feedback – it shows you're thinking about how to implement these tools in different environments. 

And the group conversation – it’s fantastic that you pushed yourself to try it, even if it felt minimal. Just the *attempt* to connect is important. It’s okay that you didn’t say much; it’s a skill that develops over time. 

You’re absolutely right to question if you’re “doing it right.” There’s no single “right” way to do this. It's about finding what works *for you* and adapting as you go. You’re learning the nuances of your urges and how to respond to them – that’s the key. 

Let’s focus on what *did* work – you used the cold water twice, and that’s a positive step.  Next week, let’s brainstorm some ways to handle situations like being at a friend’s house where you can't easily use your go-to strategy. We can think about quick, discreet ways to ground yourself. 

How does that sound?
