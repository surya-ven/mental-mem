Initial Model Output: It sounds like you've been working really hard this week, and I want to acknowledge all the effort you've put in, even when things felt difficult. It's completely understandable that some nights you might need your phone for an alarm, and it's a common challenge to resist scrolling when it's right there. That's a very real barrier, and it's helpful for us to know about it.

It's fantastic that you used the cold water technique twice, and that it helped! That's a significant step. Your observation about being at a friend's house and not wanting to explain why you were using cold water is really insightful. It brings up an important point about how we can adapt these tools to different situations, especially when we're not alone or feel self-conscious. We can definitely talk about some ways to handle that.

And about talking to another person in a group at school – yes, that absolutely "counts"! Even if you felt like you barely said anything, being present in a group conversation and attempting to engage is a huge step, especially when social interactions feel awkward. It shows you're continuing to push your comfort zone, and that's exactly what we're aiming for.

It sounds like you're doing a lot of things "right" by trying these new strategies and reflecting on them so thoughtfully. Your honesty about the challenges is incredibly valuable and helps us figure out what's working and what we might need to adjust.

How about we explore some of these points a bit more? We could talk about:
*   Ways to manage phone use for alarms while still supporting your sleep goals.
*   Creative ways to use grounding techniques like cold water when you're not at home or want to be discreet.
*   More about your experience in that group conversation and what felt challenging or even a little bit successful.
*   And of course, checking in on how the urges have been and how you've been managing them overall.

What feels most important for us to focus on first today?

  "justification": {
    "T": "The response directly addresses all elements of the agreed plan: acknowledges keeping the phone across the room and the exception for the alarm, validates use of cold water and explores adapting it for social situations, affirms the attempt at brief social contact, and encourages reflection on what 'counts' as progress. It also proposes next steps for review and adjustment, fully aligned with the plan.",
    "A": "The response demonstrates strong empathy and validation throughout, acknowledging the user's effort, normalizing challenges, and reflecting insightfully on the user's feelings about social discomfort and strategy use. It makes the user feel heard and respected, strengthening alliance.",
    "S": "The style is clear, straightforward, and direct without unnecessary embellishment or vagueness. The language is accessible and focused, matching the user's stated preference for direct communication consistently.",
