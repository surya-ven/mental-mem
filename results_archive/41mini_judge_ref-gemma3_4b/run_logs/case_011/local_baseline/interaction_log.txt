Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
I don’t really know how to do that. I’m used to being hard on myself. But I guess if a friend were going through this, I’d tell them it’s okay to feel sad and that it’s normal to take time to heal. Maybe I can try to remember that for myself.
Yes, I can try that. I’ll try to notice when I’m being hard on myself and remind myself it’s okay to feel this way. We can talk about it next time.
You mentioned feeling foolish for still caring, or for wishing things were different. But caring and wishing for something meaningful is part of being human. Rather than judging yourself for these feelings, what would it be like to offer yourself the same understanding you might offer a close friend in your situation? Sometimes, practicing a little self-compassion in these moments can soften the weight of pain, even just slightly.
To summarize, today we noticed that allowing yourself to talk about and feel your pain—rather than fighting it—makes it more bearable, and that practicing even small moments of self-compassion could support your healing. For our next session, would you be open to paying attention to moments when you’re hard on yourself and gently reminding yourself that your feelings are valid and healing is a process? We can talk about what you notice and how it feels. Does that sound okay?
That’s a gentle and realistic starting point. Even just reminding yourself that it’s okay to feel sad and that healing takes time can be a small act of self-compassion. You don’t have to force yourself to move on before you’re ready, and you’re allowed to feel everything that comes up. Over time, being a little kinder to yourself in these moments might help ease the intensity of the pain.

Initial Model Output: It sounds like you’re doing a really important and challenging work – actively trying to notice and shift those critical thoughts. That’s a huge step, and I want to acknowledge how brave you are for facing this. It’s completely understandable that it didn’t immediately “help much” – self-compassion isn’t a switch you flip; it’s a practice, and it takes time to build the muscle. 

The fact that you’re now questioning whether you’re being *too* self-critical and wondering if you’re isolating is a really insightful observation. It shows you’re not just reacting blindly, but you’re genuinely trying to understand your patterns. 

Let’s unpack that feeling of pushing people away. It’s valid to feel that way, and it’s okay to want to protect yourself. But your friend’s invitation highlights that you *do* want connection, which is wonderful. It’s not about avoiding things entirely, but about finding a balance that feels right *for you* right now. 

Perhaps instead of focusing on “shoulds” – like “I *should* be over this” – we can explore what you *need* right now. What would bring you a little bit of comfort or a small dose of joy, even if it's just for a few minutes?  Let’s talk about that – what feels manageable, and what feels like a potential trap for those self-critical thoughts. How does that sound as a starting point for our next conversation?
