Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
I don’t really know how to do that. I’m used to being hard on myself. But I guess if a friend were going through this, I’d tell them it’s okay to feel sad and that it’s normal to take time to heal. Maybe I can try to remember that for myself.
Yes, I can try that. I’ll try to notice when I’m being hard on myself and remind myself it’s okay to feel this way. We can talk about it next time.
You mentioned feeling foolish for still caring, or for wishing things were different. But caring and wishing for something meaningful is part of being human. Rather than judging yourself for these feelings, what would it be like to offer yourself the same understanding you might offer a close friend in your situation? Sometimes, practicing a little self-compassion in these moments can soften the weight of pain, even just slightly.
To summarize, today we noticed that allowing yourself to talk about and feel your pain—rather than fighting it—makes it more bearable, and that practicing even small moments of self-compassion could support your healing. For our next session, would you be open to paying attention to moments when you’re hard on yourself and gently reminding yourself that your feelings are valid and healing is a process? We can talk about what you notice and how it feels. Does that sound okay?
That’s a gentle and realistic starting point. Even just reminding yourself that it’s okay to feel sad and that healing takes time can be a small act of self-compassion. You don’t have to force yourself to move on before you’re ready, and you’re allowed to feel everything that comes up. Over time, being a little kinder to yourself in these moments might help ease the intensity of the pain.

Initial Model Output: It sounds like you're really engaging with the idea of self-compassion, and it's completely understandable that it brings up some of these questions about how to best navigate your feelings and social interactions right now. It takes a lot of awareness to even notice those moments when you're being hard on yourself, like thinking you "should" be over this by now. That's a significant step, even if the shift in feeling isn't immediate.

Your experience of turning down a friend and then judging yourself for "pushing people away" highlights a very common dilemma. It's a fine line between giving yourself the space you need to heal and worrying about isolating yourself, especially when you're feeling vulnerable. It's not always clear what the "right" thing to do is, and it's natural to question whether you're being self-critical or genuinely making unhealthy choices.

Perhaps we can explore this a bit. When you felt yourself judging yourself for "pushing people away," what was the underlying worry or fear? And in that moment, what did it feel like to try and apply that self-compassion, telling yourself it's okay to still feel sad?
