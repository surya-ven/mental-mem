counselor: Hello, and welcome. I’m glad you reached out today. I understand that you’re experiencing a lot of pain after recently falling in love for the first time, only to have that person leave suddenly. That sounds incredibly difficult, and I want you to know this is a safe space to explore your feelings. Before we dive deeper, I want to ask about your preferred communication style. Some people find it helpful when a counselor is direct and offers clear guidance, while others prefer a more reflective approach, focusing on understanding and exploring emotions together. Do you have a preference for direct or reflective communication?
user: Thank you. I think I prefer a reflective style for now. I mostly just need someone to listen and help me make sense of what happened. I feel lost. I value honesty and emotional connection, and I want to heal from this. My main goal is to understand my feelings and be able to trust again.
counselor: Thank you for sharing that with ...

  "text_analyzed": "I tried to notice when I was being hard on myself, and there were a few times I caught it—like when I thought I 'should' be over this by now. I would remember to tell myself it's okay to still feel sad, but it didn't always help much. There was one situation where a friend invited me out, and I turned them down because I wasn't feeling up to it. Later, I started judging myself for \"pushing people away\" and worried that maybe I'm just making things worse for myself. I wasn't sure if I was being too self-critical or if I really was isolating in a way that's unhealthy. It made it harder to know what counts as being compassionate versus avoiding things I should try to do.",

Initial Model Output: Thank you for sharing your experience with this practice. It sounds like you really engaged with it, and that’s a significant step. It’s completely understandable that simply telling yourself it’s okay to feel sad didn’t always make the pain go away. Self-compassion isn’t about immediately changing how you feel, but rather about changing your relationship to those feelings—treating yourself with kindness instead of judgment when difficult emotions arise.

What you described with your friend is a perfect example of how complex this can be. On one hand, honoring your feelings and turning down an invitation when you’re not up to it can be an act of self-care. On the other hand, the worry about "pushing people away" and "making things worse" is also a valid concern. This isn't about being "too self-critical" or "avoiding things" in a black-and-white way. It's about navigating the nuanced space between self-preservation and healthy connection.

How did it feel when you were judging yourself for "pushing people away"? And what was the difference between that feeling and the gentle reminder that it's okay to still feel sad? Exploring that might help us understand the distinction you're trying to make between compassion and avoidance.
