Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
That’s a valuable insight. You’re noticing that some progress happens when a neutral person is present to guide the conversation. It sounds like a mediator or continuing in counseling sessions together could be an effective way to keep discussions fair and on track, especially with important issues like finances.

For practical next steps, we could work together to come up with some guidelines for these discussions—things like taking turns speaking, or pausing before responding, which a mediator can help enforce. Would you be open to drafting a basic plan or set of ground rules for your upcoming sessions, so you both know what to expect and can focus on constructive conversation?
You’re doing your best to approach the problem with flexibility and fairness, but when he shuts down other options, it leaves you feeling stuck and unsupported. Wanting a mediator makes a lot of sense, given the pattern. Even though progress feels slow, the fact that he’s willing to go to counseling and consider a mediator is still a step—many people with rigid thinking resist outside help entirely. For now, I suggest we outline a concrete plan for the mediation sessions: set clear topics, agree on ground rules, and decide how to handle moments when the conversation stalls. Would you be willing to draft these ground rules with me, so you have something to bring into your next session?
Yes, I think that’s reasonable. Having something concrete would help. I’m willing to draft the ground rules with you and bring them to our next session.
Thank you for sharing how things went. Even though you’re frustrated, it’s clear you’re still putting in the effort to keep discussions fair and open.

PAST SNIPPETS:
That’s a valuable insight. You’re noticing that some progress happens when a neutral person is present to guide the conversation. It sounds like a mediator or continuing in counseling sessions together could be an effective way to keep discussions fair and on track, especially with important issues like finances.

For practical next steps, we could work together to come up with some guidelines for these discussions—things like taking turns speaking, or pausing before responding, w...
Initial Model Output: That’s a really insightful concern – you’re absolutely right to be thoughtful about how these rules are presented. It’s completely understandable that you’d worry about them being perceived as criticism, especially given the pattern you’ve described. It’s smart to anticipate his reaction and want to frame them in a way that feels collaborative and supportive, not confrontational.

Let’s tackle this. Instead of directly stating “no interrupting,” which can feel accusatory, how about phrasing it as a way to ensure *everyone* gets a chance to be heard? For example, you could say something like: “Let’s agree to take turns speaking, and pause briefly before responding, so we can both fully express our thoughts.”

The key is to focus on the *process* and the *outcome* – creating a space for understanding – rather than pointing out a perceived flaw in his behavior. We can use “we” language to emphasize that this is about both of you working together. 

How about we brainstorm some alternative phrases for a few key areas you’re concerned about?  Perhaps we can focus on things like:

*   **Regarding interrupting:** “Let’s agree to allow each person to finish their thought before responding.”
*   **About taking turns:** “Let’s take turns speaking, and make sure we’re both hearing each other completely.”
*   **On expressing emotions:** “Let’s try to express our feelings calmly and respectfully, using ‘I’ statements – like saying ‘I feel… when…’”

Would you like to start by telling me which specific areas you're struggling with most, and we can work on crafting some gentle, collaborative phrasing together?  We can also think about how to introduce the idea of ground rules – maybe framing it as a way to “create a better way to talk” or “make our conversations more productive.”
