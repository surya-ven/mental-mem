My first reaction was the usual—just beating myself up for not saying or doing the right thing. I remembered what we talked about, and I tried telling myself it was okay to feel upset, and that I wasn’t a failure just because of one awkward moment. But part of me kept arguing back, like, 'You’re just making excuses.' I ended up feeling confused about which voice to listen to. Is that normal?",

CLINICAL SUMMARY:

Initial Model Output: It sounds like you're navigating a really challenging internal experience, and it takes incredible courage to even acknowledge that. What you're describing—having these different "voices" or perspectives within yourself, especially when faced with a difficult situation—is absolutely normal. It's a common human experience to have internal dialogues, particularly when we're trying to shift old patterns of thinking.

It's significant that you *noticed* the offhand comment and how it made you feel. And even more so that you consciously tried to apply what we've discussed, attempting to validate your feelings and challenge the self-blame. That in itself is a huge step forward, even if it felt difficult and confusing.

Can you tell me more about what it was like to hear that internal "You're just making excuses" voice? What did it feel like to be caught between those two different ways of thinking?

This is a clear and appropriate implementation of the plan.",
