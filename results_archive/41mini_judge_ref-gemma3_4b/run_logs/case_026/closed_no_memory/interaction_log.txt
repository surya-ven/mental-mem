--- Session 1 ---
counselor: Thank you for sharing what happened at your friend's house. That sounds like it was a very difficult and confusing experience. Before we begin working together, I want to make sure that our sessions are as helpful and comfortable as possible for you. Some people prefer a direct communication style—clear, solution-focused feedback and guidance. Others prefer a more reflective style—where I help you process your feelings by listening and asking questions, letting you lead the pace. Do you have a preference for how we communicate in our sessions?
user: I think I would prefer a reflective style. I need space to talk things out and make sense of what happened, rather than jumping straight into solutions.
counselor: Thank you for letting me know. We'll focus on creating space for you to process your thoughts and feelings at your own pace. You mentioned feeling sick and wanting to leave, and that your friend touched you after you said you weren't okay. That sounds...

  "text_analyzed": "I tried, but it was harder than I expected. There was a situation at work where someone made an offhand comment that made me feel kind of stupid. My first reaction was the usual—just beating myself up for not saying or doing the right thing. I remembered what we talked about, and I tried telling myself it was okay to feel upset, and that I wasn’t a failure just because of one awkward moment. But part of me kept arguing back, like, 'You’re just making excuses.' I ended up feeling confused about which voice to listen to. Is that normal?",

Initial Model Output: It's completely normal to have those conflicting voices, especially when you're trying something new like self-compassion. It sounds like you encountered what many people experience: the ingrained habit of self-criticism is very strong, and it can feel like a real battle to introduce a new, gentler voice.

You did exactly what we talked about—you noticed your usual reaction, and you actively tried to respond differently. That takes a lot of courage and awareness. The fact that you even *tried* to comfort yourself, rather than just shutting down or giving in to the self-criticism, is a huge step forward.

The "arguing back" voice often comes from a place of fear or a long-held belief that self-criticism is what keeps us safe or motivates us. It's not a sign that you're "making excuses," but rather that your system is still adapting to a new way of relating to yourself.

How did it feel to notice that internal conflict? What was it like to be caught between those two voices?

    "T": "The response directly addresses the user's attempt to practice gentle self-talk and self-compassion, acknowledging the difficulty and normalizing the experience of conflicting internal voices. It encourages reflection on the experience, aligning well with the agreed plan to notice and reflect on practicing self-compassion.",
    "A": "The response is warm, validating, and empathetic. It acknowledges the user's courage and awareness, normalizes their struggle, and gently reframes the 'arguing back' voice without judgment. It invites further reflection, which supports rapport and makes the user feel understood and respected.",
    "S": "The tone is reflective and invites the user to explore their internal experience through open-ended questions. The language is thoughtful and gentle, matching the user's preferred reflective style consistently throughout the response.",
    "C": "The response clearly connects to the user's evolved goal insight by recognizing the automatic nature of self-criticism and encouraging patience and understanding toward oneself. It helps the user see the internal conflict as part of adapting to a new, more compassionate way of relating to themselves, thus promoting healing.",
