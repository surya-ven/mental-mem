  "text_analyzed": "I tried, but it was harder than I expected. There was a situation at work where someone made an offhand comment that made me feel kind of stupid. My first reaction was the usual—just beating myself up for not saying or doing the right thing. I remembered what we talked about, and I tried telling myself it was okay to feel upset, and that I wasn’t a failure just because of one awkward moment. But part of me kept arguing back, like, 'You’re just making excuses.' I ended up feeling confused about which voice to listen to. Is that normal?",

Initial Model Output: It sounds incredibly challenging, and I truly appreciate you sharing that with me. It’s completely understandable that you felt that internal conflict – that push and pull between wanting to be kind to yourself and the persistent, critical voice. It’s really brave of you to acknowledge that you tried to use the strategies we discussed, and it’s also completely valid that it felt harder than you anticipated. 

Hearing you say you “beat yourself up” and then struggling to accept those feelings, followed by that argument with yourself – “You’re just making excuses” – that’s a really powerful and painful experience. It sounds like you’re wrestling with a very strong sense of self-criticism, and it's not uncommon to have those kinds of internal debates when something feels upsetting, especially when it’s tied to a situation involving feeling inadequate. 

It’s absolutely normal to feel confused when those different parts of yourself are vying for your attention. It’s like a little tug-of-war going on inside you.  You're recognizing that, and that’s a huge step. 

Let’s just sit with that confusion for a moment. Can you tell me a little more about what that “making excuses” voice feels like for you? Where do you think it comes from?  There’s no pressure to have all the answers, just to explore it a bit.  



**plan_for_next_session:** I’ll focus on validating the user’s struggle with self-criticism, gently exploring its roots, and helping them to differentiate between the self-compassionate voice and the critical one. We'll delve deeper into the specific feelings associated with the "stupid" comment and how it connects to their broader sense of self-worth. I’ll also introduce a simple technique for grounding and self-soothing if the intensity of the feelings increases.
