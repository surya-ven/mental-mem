Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
That sounds incredibly difficult. It's so common for old feelings of blame or shame to resurface, especially when you're reminded of what happened. Even as you start to understand, logically, that it wasn't your fault, the emotional part of you might still struggle. When those feelings come up—like the racing heart, numbness, or panic—how do you usually respond to yourself in those moments?
That’s really compassionate. Sometimes, it can be helpful to turn that same kindness toward yourself—even if it feels strange at first. When those intense feelings come up, you might try reminding yourself: 'I did the best I could in a really hard situation,' or, 'It’s okay to feel this way.' How does it feel to consider talking to yourself in this way?
Yeah, actually, I had a rough week. I thought I was starting to feel a little better, but then I saw a post online about someone else's experience and it kind of set me off. I started replaying everything again—thinking about that night, and just feeling stuck. It all came back: the guilt, the anger at myself, and even the feeling of being frozen. I felt like I was back at square one.
I feel a mix of shame and anger—mostly at myself, but sometimes at him. I keep thinking maybe I gave the wrong signals or maybe I should have left earlier. I also feel sad, like I lost some trust in myself.
It makes sense that you'd want to push those feelings away—they're painful, and it's natural to want to avoid them. Sometimes, though, that can make the feelings even more intense. Would it feel okay to talk together about what it might be like to respond to yourself with a little more understanding or gentleness in those moments? Or is there something else you feel you need right now as we talk about this setback?

That sounds incredibly difficult. It's so common for old feelings of blame or shame to resurface, especially when you're reminded of what happened.

Initial Model Output: That sounds incredibly frustrating, and it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling confused. It’s really common for that internal conflict to arise – the part of you wanting to be kind and understanding battling with the part that’s quick to self-criticize. 

It’s *absolutely* normal to have that “you’re just making excuses” voice pop up, especially when you’re already feeling vulnerable. It’s like a protective mechanism, trying to shield you from the discomfort of uncomfortable feelings. 

The fact that you recognized what you were doing – that you were trying to apply what we talked about, and that you felt pulled in two directions – shows a lot of self-awareness and a willingness to work through this. That’s a really valuable quality. 

Let’s just take a moment to acknowledge that struggle. It’s okay that it was harder than you expected. It’s okay that you’re battling those conflicting thoughts. Would you like to explore a little more about what that “you’re just making excuses” voice is telling you, or perhaps talk about how to gently acknowledge that voice without letting it completely take over?
