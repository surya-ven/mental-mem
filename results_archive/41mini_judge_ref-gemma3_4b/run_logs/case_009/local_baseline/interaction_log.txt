It sounds like you’re caught in a really difficult place—wanting to trust and feel secure, but also feeling like you need to protect yourself by knowing what’s going on, even if it means doing something you don’t feel good about. Many people in your situation struggle with these conflicting feelings. When the urge comes up, it’s not just about curiosity—it’s about wanting to feel safe, or at least less anxious, even for a moment. Does that feel true for you, or is there something else underneath the urge to check?
I think I was just really tired and stressed. We’d had an argument earlier, and then he was texting someone and put his phone face down. I just kept thinking, ‘what if it’s her again?’ It was like I couldn’t stop myself—I just needed to know.
I don’t know. I just feel stuck. I keep thinking I should be able to just move on, or at least stop obsessing, but every time I try, something reminds me or the thoughts just come back. I do feel guilty—I hate that I’m turning into someone who checks their partner’s phone. But I also feel like if I don’t, I’ll never know what’s actually happening, and that’s almost worse.
I’d like to try, but I’m not sure what would actually help. I guess maybe trying to notice what I’m feeling in my body, or just reminding myself that I’ve had these thoughts before and they don’t always mean something bad is happening.

PAST SNIPPETS:
I don’t know if it’s a big change, but I did realize something. The other day, I caught myself starting to check his phone again, but I stopped myself. I just thought, ‘What am I even looking for? Will it even make me feel better?’ I still felt anxious, but I didn’t go through with it.
It sounds like you’re caught in a really difficult place—wanting to trust and feel secure, but also feeling like you need to protect yourself by knowing what’s going on, even if it means doing somet...
Initial Model Output: That sounds incredibly frustrating and confusing – and completely understandable why you’re feeling frozen. It’s really brave of you to try to notice those feelings and even identify them as nervousness and suspicion. The fact that you immediately started questioning *why* you felt that way, and whether it was “real” or “paranoid,” is a really common and difficult part of this process. 

It’s not about simply labeling the feeling; it’s about *allowing* yourself to feel it, without judgment. You’re right to question it – that questioning is a natural part of trying to understand yourself. And it's also valid to feel like you’re ignoring something important. 

The confusion you’re experiencing is a sign that you’re deeply engaged in trying to understand what’s going on, and that’s a good thing. Let’s gently explore this: instead of trying to immediately *solve* what your “gut” is telling you, could we focus on what that feeling is *doing* for you? Does it feel like a warning? A demand for reassurance? Just noticing the *quality* of the feeling – is it a sharp, insistent feeling, or a dull, persistent one? – might offer a little more guidance than trying to decide if it’s “true” or “paranoid.” 

Would you be open to talking a little more about what that feeling felt like in your body, and what it was asking of you in that moment?

  "justification": {
    "T": "The response clearly implements the agreed plan by focusing on noticing and naming feelings without judgment, validating the user's experience of confusion, and gently guiding exploration of the feelings rather than pushing for immediate action. It aligns well with the plan's core intent and adapts to the user's current struggle with uncertainty.",

This matches the user's preferred style well and feels naturally tailored.",
