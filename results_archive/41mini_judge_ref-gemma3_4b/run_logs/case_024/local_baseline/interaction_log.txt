Mem0 RAG Search: UserID='case_024_baseline_local', Query='I did try the 5-4-3-2-1 thing a couple times when I felt anxious, and sometimes it helped me calm down a little. But there was one situation where I felt confused about whether I should use it or not. My partner was acting kind of distant one evening, and I couldn’t tell if I was overreacting or if something was actually wrong. I started to get anxious, but I also felt like maybe I should talk to them instead of just doing the grounding thing. I wasn’t sure which was the right move, so I ended up not really doing either.

That sounds like a really solid plan. Remember, the goal isn’t to make the anxiety go away instantly, but to give yourself a tool to ride out those intense moments and remind yourself that you’re safe in the present. You’ve already shown you can be self-aware and reflective—this is just another way to build on that strength.

That’s understandable, and it’s a sign of progress that you’re able to pause and try to reassure yourself before reaching out for reassurance from your partner. It’s also okay to need support from them sometimes—that’s part of being in a relationship. If you like, we can explore some ways you might self-soothe or manage the anxiety in those moments, as well as talk about how to share your feelings with your partner in a way that feels safe for you. Would you be interested in trying that together?
Yeah, I can do that. I’ll try the 5-4-3-2-1 thing whenever I feel the anxiety coming on. Hopefully it helps.

A little bit. I still get anxious, but I try to remind myself that my partner hasn’t done anything to make me doubt them. Sometimes I can calm myself down, but other times I still want to ask for reassurance or check in with them more than I probably need to.

Initial Model Output: That’s incredibly insightful, and it’s *absolutely* normal to feel that way. It sounds like you’re navigating a really tricky space – wanting to manage your anxiety while also wanting connection and reassurance from your partner. It’s completely understandable that you got stuck, feeling unsure about whether to use the grounding technique or address the situation directly. 

It’s a sign of your thoughtfulness that you’re even questioning *how* to respond, rather than just reacting automatically. Recognizing that confusion is a really valuable step in learning to regulate your emotions. 

Let’s talk about this. It’s not about *always* choosing one thing over the other, but about recognizing the different needs in different situations. Sometimes, a quick grounding exercise can be exactly what you need to create a little space and clarity before you decide how to approach your partner. Other times, a conversation is the right move. 

Could we explore what specifically made you hesitate in that situation? Was it fear of making things worse, or perhaps feeling like you weren’t being “fair” by not seeking reassurance?
