That sounds like a really solid plan. Remember, the goal isn’t to make the anxiety go away instantly, but to give yourself a tool to ride out those intense moments and remind yourself that you’re safe in the present. You’ve already shown you can be self-aware and reflective—this is just another way to build on that strength.

That’s understandable, and it’s a sign of progress that you’re able to pause and try to reassure yourself before reaching out for reassurance from your partner. It’s also okay to need support from them sometimes—that’s part of being in a relationship. If you like, we can explore some ways you might self-soothe or manage the anxiety in those moments, as well as talk about how to share your feelings with your partner in a way that feels safe for you. Would you be interested in trying that together?
Yeah, I can do that. I’ll try the 5-4-3-2-1 thing whenever I feel the anxiety coming on. Hopefully it helps.
It’s understandable to feel disappointed or frustrated, but your reaction is not a failure—it's part of a process. It takes time for your body and mind to learn new ways of responding, especially when old fears get activated. You’re already starting to shift your relationship with these thoughts by noticing them and connecting them to your past, rather than automatically believing them or acting on them. That’s meaningful progress, even if it doesn’t always feel like it.

When you notice the anxiety rising, your first instinct is to try to push it away or distract yourself. Sometimes that helps, but sometimes it doesn’t. Would you be willing to try a grounding technique today to help you reconnect with the present moment when those worries hit? Or, if you prefer, we can talk about other tools that might feel supportive.
A little bit. I still get anxious, but I try to remind myself that my partner hasn’t done anything to make me doubt them. Sometimes I can calm myself down, but other times I still want to ask for reassurance or check in with them more than I probably need to.

Remember, the goal isn’t to make the anxiety go away instantly, but to give yourself a tool to ride out those intense moments and remind yourself that you’re safe in the present. You’ve already shown you can be self-aware and reflective—this is just another way to build on that strength.

Initial Model Output: That’s a really insightful observation, and it’s completely normal to feel that confusion! It sounds like you're grappling with a common dilemma: when is it best to self-soothe and manage your own anxiety, and when is it appropriate or necessary to engage with an external situation or person?

You’re not missing anything at all. In fact, you're demonstrating a very important step in building emotional intelligence – discerning between internal anxiety and external reality. The 5-4-3-2-1 technique is fantastic for when your anxiety is primarily an internal experience (e.g., worries about things that aren’t happening in the present, or when your thoughts are spiraling). However, if there’s a real, observable change in your partner’s behavior, your instinct to talk to them instead of just grounding yourself is valid.

It’s not about choosing one over the other as the "right" move every time. Sometimes, you might do a quick grounding exercise to calm yourself enough to then have a productive conversation. Other times, the anxiety might be a signal that something needs to be addressed externally. The key is learning to differentiate.

Would you be open to exploring how you might approach those situations where you’re unsure? We could talk about how to use grounding to help you assess the situation more clearly, and then how to communicate your feelings to your partner in a way that feels safe and constructive, rather than purely driven by anxiety.
