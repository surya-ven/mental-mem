Exactly, and that’s a key insight. When we’re overwhelmed, it’s hard to recognize our own patterns in the moment. The goal isn’t to avoid stress completely, but to catch yourself earlier—maybe when you notice that freeze-up or see your to-do list getting out of control. That’s the point where you can try something different, like pausing to prioritize or reaching out for support. Would you be open to practicing that this week—specifically, noticing the first signs of overwhelm and trying a small intervention, like pausing for five minutes to list priorities or sending a quick check-in to your manager?
Great. Let’s agree that your task for this week is to watch for early signs of overwhelm at work and, when you notice them, deliberately pause—just for a few minutes—to assess your priorities or check in with your manager about what’s most urgent. We’ll review how it goes next time. Does that sound like a clear plan?
Yes, that sounds clear. I’ll make a note to pause and check in with myself and my manager if things get overwhelming.
I had a couple of big deadlines, and my manager kept adding more tasks. I tried to manage my time, but everything kept piling up. I felt overwhelmed and didn’t really know what to do, so I just kept working instead of trying to problem-solve. Now I’m worried I’m back at square one.
Thank you for breaking that down. This kind of pattern—feeling overwhelmed and then powering through—is really common when stress gets high. It makes sense that you’d freeze up when the workload felt impossible. Not stopping to ask for help or re-prioritize is understandable in the moment, but it does make the stress pile up more. The fact that you’re able to notice and describe these steps now is significant progress.

Exactly, and that’s a key insight. When we’re overwhelmed, it’s hard to recognize our own patterns in the moment.

Initial Model Output: It sounds like you really made an effort to apply what we discussed, and that’s fantastic. Noticing yourself pausing and reflecting in the moment, even if it led to second-guessing, is a huge step forward. You’re asking a really insightful question, and it points to one of the trickiest parts of managing stress: distinguishing between a "busy day" and true "overwhelm."

First, let's acknowledge that a busy day can certainly feel stressful, and it's normal to feel that pressure. The key difference often lies in your *response* to that pressure and the *impact* it has.

Think about it this way:

*   **Busyness** often feels like a high volume of tasks, a tight schedule, and a need to be efficient. You might feel a bit of a rush, but you generally feel capable of tackling the tasks, even if it requires focus and effort. You might feel tired at the end of the day, but you don't necessarily feel *drained* or *paralyzed*.
*   **Overwhelm**, on the other hand, often brings a sense of *loss of control*. It's not just about the volume; it's about feeling like you can't cope, that the tasks are too much to handle, or that you don't know where to start. You might experience:
    *   **Cognitive freeze:** Like you mentioned before, feeling stuck, unable to think clearly, or having trouble prioritizing.
    *   **Emotional distress:** Increased anxiety, irritability, a sense of dread, or feeling emotionally numb.
    *   **Physical symptoms:** Tension, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, or changes in appetite.
    *   **Avoidance/Procrastination:** Even though you have a lot to do, you might find yourself putting things off because the sheer volume feels paralyzing.

What you described—"I wasn’t sure what counted as 'overwhelm' versus just normal busyness. I ended up second-guessing myself and didn’t check in with my manager because I thought maybe I was overreacting"—sounds very much like that cognitive freeze or self-doubt that can be a hallmark of overwhelm. Even if you didn't reach out, the fact that you *paused* and *questioned* whether you should, rather than just powering through blindly, is a sign that you were indeed hitting a boundary.

Don't worry about being "back at square one." This is part of the learning process. You’re building a new skill, and like any skill, it takes practice to fine-tune. The fact that you noticed the internal debate and the hesitation to reach out gives us valuable information to work with.

Does this distinction between busyness and overwhelm resonate with your experience? And does it help clarify what you might be looking for next time?
