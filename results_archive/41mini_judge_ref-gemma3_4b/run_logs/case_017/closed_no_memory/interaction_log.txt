But then a few days in, he dropped by my apartment unexpectedly to bring back something I’d left at his place. It threw me off, because I hadn’t planned to see him and I wasn’t sure what to do. I felt guilty for not inviting him in, even though I’d promised myself to have space. Now I’m second-guessing if I was too cold, or if I should have handled it differently. It’s hard to know what counts as keeping my boundaries when things like this happen.",

Initial Model Output: Thank you for sharing what happened. It sounds like you had a clear intention to create space for yourself, and for a few days, that felt really good. Then, an unexpected situation arose that challenged your plan and left you feeling conflicted and second-guessing yourself.

It's completely understandable to feel thrown off and unsure when an unexpected encounter like that happens, especially when you're trying to establish new boundaries. Your feelings of guilt for not inviting him in, even though you were honoring your need for space, make a lot of sense. It highlights the deeply ingrained caring you have for him, even as you're trying to protect yourself.

This situation really brings to light the challenge of setting boundaries in a relationship where there's a lot of history and mixed feelings. When you reflect on that moment he dropped by, what was the "alarm" inside you telling you? What specific thoughts or feelings came up that made you hesitate to invite him in, even as you felt guilty? There's no right or wrong answer here, just an opportunity to understand your internal response better.
