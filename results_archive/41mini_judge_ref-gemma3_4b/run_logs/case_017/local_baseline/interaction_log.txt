I think I want to be close to him, so I make plans. But when it comes time to actually see him or talk to him, I just feel really anxious and kind of numb. I start thinking about how he cheated, and I wonder if he’ll ever really change. Sometimes I even feel angry at myself for missing him. So, I end up canceling or just avoiding him.
It sounds like the recent setbacks—his cheating again and your difficulty keeping plans—have deepened your sense of confusion, but also made you more aware of your need for space and safety. I wonder, as you look back over our conversations, what have you learned about yourself and your needs in relationships? Are there any moments of clarity or self-understanding that stand out for you?
That exhaustion and sense of numbness are such understandable responses to being hurt repeatedly. It’s so hard to hold onto hope and also carry doubt at the same time. The guilt and anger you describe—both at him and at yourself—sound like they’re weighing heavily on you. Sometimes, when we feel stuck in a cycle like this, our mind and body step in to protect us, even if it means pulling away or shutting down.

If you gently check in with yourself right now, what do you most need in this moment? Is it reassurance, space, clarity, or something else? And as you sit with the question of giving him another chance, what part of you is hoping for that, and what part of you is hesitant or afraid?
That sounds like a compassionate and brave step—giving yourself the space you’ve been craving, and using that time to notice what you feel and need. Let’s agree together that, for the next week, you’ll focus on taking space from your fiancé, avoid making new plans, and journal about your experiences and feelings, especially any shifts in your sense of safety, value, or clarity. We’ll check in next time about what you discover. How does that feel as a next step?
Thank you for being so open about what you’re going through, even as things have gotten harder. I can hear how deeply conflicted you feel—part of you still loves and cares for him, but another part is pulling away, especially after being hurt again. It sounds like you’re stuck between wanting to believe in the relationship and needing to protect yourself from more pain.

When you reflect on these setbacks—the repeated betrayals and your difficulty following through on plans—what do you notice about how you’re feeling toward him, and toward yourself? Are there certain thoughts or emotions that keep coming up, especially when you think about giving him another chance?

Initial Model Output: That’s a really insightful observation, and it highlights just how complex this is for you. It’s completely understandable that you felt a wave of guilt and second-guessing after he unexpectedly showed up – it directly challenged the space you’d intentionally created. It sounds like you’re wrestling with wanting to honor your boundaries while also experiencing a genuine, human connection with him. 

It’s so common to feel this way when you’re trying to establish new boundaries after a period of hurt. Your mind is trying to reconcile the need for protection with the pull of wanting connection. Let’s unpack that a little. What specifically about his visit triggered those feelings of guilt and doubt? And, more importantly, what *did* you need in that moment, beyond just protecting yourself?
