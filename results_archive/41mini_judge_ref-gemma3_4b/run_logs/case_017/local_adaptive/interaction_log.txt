  "text_analyzed": "At first, it actually felt kind of freeing to not have to think about making plans or texting him. But then a few days in, he dropped by my apartment unexpectedly to bring back something I’d left at his place. It threw me off, because I hadn’t planned to see him and I wasn’t sure what to do. I felt guilty for not inviting him in, even though I’d promised myself to have space. Now I’m second-guessing if I was too cold, or if I should have handled it differently. It’s hard to know what counts as keeping my boundaries when things like this happen.",

Initial Model Output: Okay, thank you for sharing that. It sounds incredibly confusing and emotionally taxing to be experiencing this push and pull – the relief of having space, followed by the feeling of being unsettled and then immediately questioning yourself about how you reacted. It’s completely understandable that you’re second-guessing yourself after that unexpected visit. 

It’s really brave of you to articulate this struggle with boundaries, and it highlights just how deeply this situation is affecting you. You mentioned feeling guilty for not inviting him in, even after you’d set a boundary for yourself. That’s a really revealing thing to notice – it shows how much you value his presence, even when it creates internal conflict. 

Let’s take a moment to unpack that. It’s okay to feel conflicted when someone you care about unexpectedly shows up. It’s also understandable that you'd feel a little guilty, especially when you’ve been trying to establish space for yourself.  

Instead of trying to figure out *exactly* what you “should” have done – which, as you said, feels overwhelming – let’s just focus on what you *felt* in that moment, and what your needs were. Can you tell me a little more about what that space meant to you, and what feeling it was trying to protect?  We can explore this together, gently, without judgment.
