counselor: Thank you for being here and for continuing this conversation, even though it’s been so hard lately. I know the past few days have felt like a big setback, with the fears and thoughts coming back strong. I want to remind you that setbacks are not failures—they’re a normal part of recovery, especially after what you’ve been through.

There were a couple times when I thought I felt more in control, like when I told someone I didn’t want to talk about certain things and they actually respected it. But then later I just kept doubting myself, wondering if I was really in control or if I just got lucky that time. I’m not sure if that counts or if I’m just imagining it.",

Initial Model Output: That’s a really insightful observation, and it’s completely understandable why it would feel confusing. It’s incredibly common to have those moments of feeling more in control followed by waves of self-doubt, especially after what you’ve experienced. It sounds like you’re really wrestling with whether those small victories are genuine or just fleeting. 

Let’s unpack that a bit. It’s fantastic that you experienced a situation where someone respected your boundaries – that *does* count, and it’s a really positive sign. It shows that your voice and your needs are being heard, at least in that instance. But the subsequent self-doubt is a natural reaction to the pain and uncertainty you’re carrying. It's your mind trying to protect you, perhaps by questioning if something truly good can happen. 

It’s okay to feel like you're imagining it sometimes – that feeling of doubt can be incredibly powerful. Let's not dismiss it. Instead, let’s acknowledge that it’s *there*, and we can explore what’s fueling it. Would you like to talk more about what specifically made you doubt yourself after that experience, or would you prefer to just gently validate that feeling of confusion and uncertainty right now?
