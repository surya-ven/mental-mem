Yeah, I can do that. I’ll try to notice if anything else makes me feel safer, even if it’s just for a moment. At least that feels like something I can control.
Thank you for continuing to share your experience with me. It’s clear that what you went through was deeply violating, and it’s completely understandable that it’s hard to trust anyone after being treated that way. You’ve made it clear that you don’t want to be analyzed or pushed, and I respect that. Can I ask—are there any moments, even small ones, when you have felt a little bit safer or more in control since all of this happened?
Looking at what we’ve discussed so far, it seems like the key thing has been holding onto any small area of control you can find, like deciding when to shut things out. Would you agree that, for now, focusing on these moments—however small—might be one way to get through the worst days? If you’re open to it, maybe next time we could talk about whether there’s anything else, even minor, that gives you a sense of safety or control. Does that sound okay?
That’s an important insight. Even after everything you’ve been through, you still have choices that are yours. I know it doesn’t make up for what you lost, but recognizing that you still have some power—like deciding when and how to create your own safety—can be a starting point. We can keep focusing on building those small areas of control, without rushing or going into anything you’re not ready for. How does it feel to talk about it this way?
Both. I kind of hate that I have to do it, but it’s better than nothing. Sometimes I get this thought that at least I can still decide to shut things out—that’s mine, no one else’s. It reminds me that not everything can be taken away, even if it feels like most things were.

Yeah, I can do that. I’ll try to notice if anything else makes me feel safer, even if it’s just for a moment. At least that feels like something I can control.
Thank you for continuing to share your experience with me. It’s clear that what you went through was deeply violating, and it’s completely understandable that it’s hard to trust anyone after being treated that way.

Initial Model Output: It sounds like you're navigating a really complex space right now. On one hand, you had experiences where your boundaries were respected, which gave you a sense of control. That's a significant positive step. On the other hand, the doubt and questioning that followed are completely understandable, given what you've been through. It's hard to trust those moments when so much has been taken from you.

What you're describing absolutely "counts." Feeling that moment of control, even if it was followed by doubt, is a real experience. And the fact that you noticed it, and then questioned it, shows a lot of awareness. It's not about whether you "got lucky" or if it was "real" control, but that you observed a situation where your will was respected.

How does it feel to acknowledge that even those moments of questioning and doubt are part of the process of trying to reclaim a sense of control?

  "justification": {
    "T": "The response directly addresses the user's agreed plan to notice and keep track of moments that create a sense of control. It validates the user's experience of feeling control when boundaries were respected and acknowledges the subsequent doubt, thus implementing the plan clearly and appropriately. It also invites further reflection, aligning well with the plan's intent to discuss these moments together.",
    "A": "The response demonstrates clear and specific validation of the user's feelings, acknowledging both the positive experience and the doubt that followed. It reflects understanding of the user's complex emotional state and encourages awareness, which strengthens the therapeutic alliance beyond basic empathy.",
    "S": "The style is direct and clear without being intrusive or pushy. The language is honest and straightforward, matching the user's preferred communication style. The response avoids hidden probing and maintains a respectful tone, making it well aligned with the user's stated preference.",
    "C": "The response connects well to the user's evolved goal insight by emphasizing the user's agency in protecting themselves and recognizing small areas of control as meaningful. It highlights the coping mechanism and foundation for healing, thus supporting progress toward the user's broader therapeutic goals.",
