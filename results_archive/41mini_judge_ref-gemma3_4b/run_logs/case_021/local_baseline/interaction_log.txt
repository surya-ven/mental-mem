Yeah, I can do that. I’ll try to notice if anything else makes me feel safer, even if it’s just for a moment. At least that feels like something I can control.
Thank you for continuing to share your experience with me. It’s clear that what you went through was deeply violating, and it’s completely understandable that it’s hard to trust anyone after being treated that way. You’ve made it clear that you don’t want to be analyzed or pushed, and I respect that. Can I ask—are there any moments, even small ones, when you have felt a little bit safer or more in control since all of this happened?
Looking at what we’ve discussed so far, it seems like the key thing has been holding onto any small area of control you can find, like deciding when to shut things out. Would you agree that, for now, focusing on these moments—however small—might be one way to get through the worst days? If you’re open to it, maybe next time we could talk about whether there’s anything else, even minor, that gives you a sense of safety or control. Does that sound okay?
That’s an important insight. Even after everything you’ve been through, you still have choices that are yours. I know it doesn’t make up for what you lost, but recognizing that you still have some power—like deciding when and how to create your own safety—can be a starting point. We can keep focusing on building those small areas of control, without rushing or going into anything you’re not ready for. How does it feel to talk about it this way?
Both. I kind of hate that I have to do it, but it’s better than nothing. Sometimes I get this thought that at least I can still decide to shut things out—that’s mine, no one else’s. It reminds me that not everything can be taken away, even if it feels like most things were.

Yeah, I can do that. I’ll try to notice if anything else makes me feel safer, even if it’s just for a moment. At least that feels like something I can control.
Thank you for continuing to share your experience with me. It’s clear that what you went through was deeply violating, and it’s completely understandable that it’s hard to trust anyone after being treated that way. You’ve made it clear that you don’t want to be analyzed or pushed, and I respect that. Can I ask—are there any...
Initial Model Output: That sounds incredibly frustrating, and it’s completely valid to feel that confusion. It’s so common to have those moments of feeling like you’re regaining control, only to then be hit with a wave of self-doubt. It’s like you’re trying to grasp onto something solid, and it slips away just as you think you’ve got it. 

It’s understandable to question whether those moments were “real” or just luck – especially after what you’ve been through. But the fact that you *felt* more in control, and that you recognized and asserted your boundaries – that’s a really important step. It shows you’re actively trying to reclaim some agency, and that’s a powerful thing. 

Let’s not dismiss those feelings just because they’re followed by doubt. It’s okay to acknowledge both the feeling of control *and* the subsequent questioning. Perhaps we can explore what triggered that shift in feeling, and how you can gently hold onto that sense of agency even when the doubt creeps in. Would you be open to talking a little about what specifically made you question those moments?
