Overall Focus: Establishing therapeutic rapport and clarifying communication preferences to address ongoing relational conflict characterized by frequent arguments and lack of agreement.

Initial Model Output: Okay, that sounds incredibly frustrating and disheartening. It’s really tough when you try to address something important and it feels like you’re met with a dismissive response – that “sure, whatever” can really leave you feeling unheard and like your efforts aren’t valued. It’s completely understandable that you’re now questioning whether anything was actually agreed upon and wondering if you should even bring it up again. 

Given how you’ve described it, and remembering you prefer a direct approach, let’s focus on a few things. First, let's acknowledge that your feeling of being unheard is valid and important. It’s not about *if* you should bring it up, but *how* you bring it up. 

I want to help you figure out a way to communicate this need for clarity and mutual agreement more effectively.  Could you give me a specific example of a recent conflict where this happened? Just a brief description of what was said and how you felt would be really helpful.  We don't need to get lost in analysis right now – let’s just focus on getting a clear picture of what happened.

**Plan for Next Session:** We’ll unpack that specific example to identify what went wrong in the communication. Then, we’ll brainstorm some concrete ways you can express your need for a discussion and agreement – something beyond just “sure, whatever.” We can also look at what might be driving your partner's reaction and how you can address that in a way that feels respectful, while still advocating for your needs.

This aligns well with the plan's core intent.",
