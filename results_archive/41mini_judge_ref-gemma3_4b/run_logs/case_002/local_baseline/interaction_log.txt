Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
Thank you for sharing how things went, even though it was tough. I want to be direct: setbacks like this are common and don’t mean you’ve failed or that things can’t improve. The pressure to "get it right" after making changes can sometimes spike your anxiety even more. This is a sign that the cycle of anxiety and performance pressure is still active—it takes time and consistent practice to break that pattern.

Let’s consolidate what we’ve learned: 
- Trying to "relax" with the hope that things will instantly improve can actually keep the focus on performance, which maintains anxiety.
- The real goal for now isn’t to "achieve" an erection or intercourse, but to completely take the pressure off and rebuild positive, pressure-free experiences with your wife.

Here’s a clear next step: 
1. Commit together with your wife to put intercourse on hold for now. Instead, focus on sensate focus exercises—a step-by-step plan to rebuild physical closeness and retrain your body’s response without performance pressure. I can give you specific, practical instructions for this.
2. Talk honestly with your wife about this approach: you’re a team, experimenting together, and setbacks are expected along the way.
3. Keep a simple log of what you try, how you feel, and any changes you notice—even small wins count.

Do you feel ready to try sensate focus together, and would you like detailed instructions to get started?
Great—you’re taking a proactive step by agreeing to this plan. For the next week or two, your agreed task is:

Practice the first stage of sensate focus with your wife—non-genital, non-breast touching only, taking turns giving and receiving touch, while focusing on sensations rather than performance or arousal. No intercourse or attempts at intercourse. Keep a brief log of experiences, feelings, and any small positive moments. We’ll review what you notice and adjust as needed.

Let’s check back in after you’ve tried this together. If you have questions or run into challenges along the way, write them down or message me, and we’ll troubleshoot together. You’re not alone in this process.
I hear how frustrating and discouraging this setback feels, especially after making real efforts. It’s completely normal to hope for quick improvement, but it’s also normal for this process to have ups and downs. Even with changes in approach, it often takes time for your body and mind to break out of old cycles—sometimes setbacks are part of that process, not a sign of failure.

Here’s what I want you to know:

1. One setback doesn’t mean you’re back to square one. The anxiety about the problem is deeply conditioned, and even with progress, it can resurface under pressure or expectation.
2. The fact that you’re still attracted to your wife and want things to improve is a strong foundation to build on.
3. Feeling defeated now is understandable, but it doesn’t mean things can’t improve—this is a signal that we may need to add some new strategies.

**Next Steps:**
- For now, put intercourse aside as a goal. Focus on all forms of physical closeness—touch, kissing, massage, even sensual play—without any expectation or attempt at penetration. This is called ‘sensate focus’ and it’s a proven way to retrain your body’s response, reduce anxiety, and build positive experiences together. If at any point you become aroused, allow it, but don’t shift the focus to intercourse.
- Talk openly with your wife and share that setbacks are normal, and that you’re both working as a team, not against each other. Sometimes including her in the process relieves pressure because it’s not just your burden to bear.
- If the emotional impact is heavy, consider checking in with your doctor about mood or anxiety. Sometimes counseling or short-term medication can help break the cycle.
- Keep a simple log of your experiences—what you tried, how you felt, and any small wins (even non-sexual ones). This can help identify patterns and build confidence over time.

Most importantly, don’t let a single setback convince you that lasting change isn’t possible. Would you like some more detailed guidance on how to do sensate focus exercises, or help with talking to your wife about being a team in this?
I tried to do what we talked about—cutting back on alcohol, focusing on just being close with my wife, and not putting pressure on myself for intercourse. But last night we tried to be intimate and the same problem happened. I lost my erection, and honestly, it felt even worse than before because I’d really hoped things would get better if I just relaxed. My wife was upset again and I just felt completely defeated. I’m starting to worry that nothing will change, and it’s making me even more depressed. I’m not sure what else I can do at this point.
Yes, I think being more structured about this could help. I’d appreciate clear, step-by-step instructions for what to do with the sensate focus exercises. I’ll talk to my wife and we’ll try this approach, and I’ll keep track of how it goes.

PAST SNIPPETS:
Thank you for sharing how things went, even though it was tough. I want to be direct: setbacks like this are common and don’t mean you’ve failed or that things can’t improve. The pressure to "get it right" after making changes can sometimes spike your anxiety even more. This is a sign that the cycle of anxiety and performance pressure is still active—it takes time and consistent practice to break that pattern.

Let’s consolidate what we’ve learned: 
- Trying to "relax" with the ho...
Initial Model Output: That’s a really understandable feeling, and it’s great that you’re recognizing the complexities of this process. It sounds like you’re navigating a tricky balance between honoring the exercise’s intention and responding to your wife’s desire for connection. 

Let’s unpack this. The core of sensate focus isn’t about rigidly stopping at the *first* sign of arousal – it’s about *shifting* the focus away from performance and towards the experience of touch itself. Your wife’s reaction is valid; it’s natural for her to want to explore a connection that feels good.

Here’s what I suggest: Instead of immediately stopping when arousal happens, let’s try a modified approach. When she becomes aroused, acknowledge it with her – “I notice you’re feeling aroused, and that’s okay.” Then, gently guide her back to the exercise. You could say something like, “Let’s continue focusing on the sensations, just like we practiced. Let’s both take a deep breath and really notice the feeling of our skin touching.” 

It’s about redirecting her desire to experience *together*, rather than stopping it entirely. You’re both learning how to reconnect with pleasure in a new way, and it’s okay if that takes a little adjustment.

Would you like me to help you craft some specific phrases you can use in those moments, or would you like to talk through some different ways to handle the shifting dynamic?
