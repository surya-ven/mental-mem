State: The user remains anxious and vulnerable when addressing confidentiality issues, triggered by previous breaches of trust, but demonstrates insight, resilience, and openness to utilizing coping strategies such as written notes to facilitate communication and rebuild trust in therapy.
Milestones: ["User shared ongoing impact of prior confidentiality breach on current therapy engagement and trust.", "User acknowledged anxiety triggered specifically by conversations about confidentiality and fear of judgment.", "Counselor normalized the user's setback as a protective, natural response rather than failure.", "User agreed to utilize written communication aids to express concerns during therapy sessions.", "Collaborative discussion about incremental practice steps to reduce anxiety and increase confidence.", "User expressed willingness to prepare and practice scripts or notes to support future therapy interactions."]
Themes: ["Persistent anxiety related to confidentiality discussions in therapy", "Residual mistrust stemming from previous therapist\u2019s privacy violation", "User\u2019s recognition of the need for self-advocacy and boundary setting", "Value of external tools (e.g., notes, scripts) to manage communication challenges", "Gradual rebuilding of trust through small, manageable steps", "User\u2019s engagement and hopefulness about using practical strategies to overcome setbacks"]
Quotes: ["Yes, that sounds good. I think having something written out will make it easier for me to get my point across, especially if I get nervous."]
Reflections: This session reinforced the significant impact of prior confidentiality violations on the user's trust and anxiety in therapy. The user’s willingness to try new strategies, particularly written communication aids, signals a pivotal shift toward regaining control and fostering safety in therapeutic relationships.

CLINICAL SUMMARY:
Overall Focus: Processing the user’s recent setback related to anxiety when discussing confidentiality with a new therapist, reinforcing normalization of emotional responses to past breaches of trust, and collaboratively emphasizing practical strategies such as using written communication aids and practicing conversations to regain control and reduce anxiety.

Initial Model Output: I understand your concern about situations where a therapist might share information, even if they frame it as "necessary for your care," especially after you've expressed your concerns about confidentiality. That's a very valid and important question to address, and it highlights exactly why we're working on this script together.

It's absolutely *not* okay for a therapist to share information from your sessions with someone else, like a supervisor or your partner, without your explicit, informed consent, *unless* there is a very specific and legally mandated exception to confidentiality (like a direct threat of harm to yourself or others, or child/elder abuse). Even in those rare and extreme circumstances, a therapist is typically obligated to discuss this with you first, if at all possible, and to share only the minimum necessary information.

The situation you're describing – where a therapist might unilaterally decide to share information for "your care" without your agreement – is a significant breach of trust and professional ethics. Your concerns are entirely justified.

This is precisely why we need to ensure your script covers these "blurry" areas. We can certainly work on language that clearly communicates your expectations around confidentiality, including:

*   **Your understanding of confidentiality:** What you expect to be kept private and who you expect to be privy to your information.
*   **Your boundaries regarding disclosure:** Stating that you expect to be consulted and give explicit consent *before* any information is shared, even for supervisory purposes or with other care providers (unless it's an emergency exception you both understand).
*   **Clarifying what "necessary for care" means to *you*:** Emphasizing that you want to be part of that discussion and decision-making process.
*   **What you expect if a therapist feels they *must* break confidentiality:** That they will inform you first, if possible, and explain the specific reason and legal basis.

We can draft a script that not only expresses your need for confidentiality but also addresses these potential "what if" scenarios, making it clear that *your* agreement is paramount. This will empower you to set clear boundaries from the outset and communicate your expectations proactively.

How does that sound as a starting point for refining our script? We can make sure it addresses these very real and important concerns you have.
