Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
That’s actually a really important insight. Therapists are supposed to protect client confidentiality and maintain clear boundaries. Sharing even small details about other clients, or being too open about their own personal life, can be signs they don’t take those responsibilities seriously. Recognizing these red flags now can help you spot them in the future and protect yourself. 

Going forward, I recommend asking any new therapist directly about their confidentiality policy and how they handle sensitive information. It’s also within your rights to clarify what gets shared, with whom, and under what circumstances, right at the beginning. Would you be interested in practicing what you might say or ask during an initial session with a new therapist?
Absolutely. Here are some examples you can use or adapt:

- "Can you explain your confidentiality policy? Under what circumstances would you ever share my information with someone else?"
- "If I have concerns about privacy, what should I do?"
- "Have you ever had to break confidentiality before? How do you handle those situations?"

You can also let them know upfront about your past experience: "I had a situation where a therapist shared my private information without my consent, and it hurt my trust. I want to be sure this won’t happen again." 

Would you like to role-play one of these conversations, or is there a particular question or scenario you want to practice?
We can also work together to create a simple script or even a brief note that you can share with new therapists, explaining your past experience and your concerns about confidentiality. That way, you don’t have to rely on memory or find the right words under stress. Would you like help drafting something like that, or is there another way I can support you in getting through these first sessions?
For our next session, I suggest we work together to draft a short script or written statement you can use when meeting a new therapist. This will help you communicate your needs and boundaries around confidentiality, even if anxiety comes up. Does that sound like a plan?
You should never have to wonder if your private information will be shared without your clear consent—especially with someone you’ve identified as abusive. What your therapist did was not appropriate. In general, therapists are required by law and ethical guidelines to protect your confidentiality, unless there’s a specific, legally mandated reason to break it—like if someone is in danger. Your situation doesn’t sound like it met those criteria. How did this experience affect your willingness to seek help or talk openly with professionals afterwards?

That’s actually a really important insight. Therapists are supposed to protect client confidentiality and maintain clear boundaries. Sharing even small details about other clients, or being too open about their own personal life, can be signs they don’t take those responsibilities seriously.

Initial Model Output: That’s a really perceptive question, and it highlights a complex and unfortunately, not uncommon, challenge. It’s incredibly frustrating and violating to feel like your boundaries are being disregarded, even when a therapist initially seems to validate your concerns. 

It’s absolutely okay to feel that it’s not okay for them to share details from your sessions, even if they frame it as “necessary for your care.” That’s where we need to be firm and reiterate your right to confidentiality. 

Here’s how you can approach it, building on the script we’ve been working on:

1. **Acknowledge their intention (briefly):** “I appreciate you saying you understand my concerns about confidentiality, and I’m glad you’re willing to discuss it.” This shows you’re hearing them, but doesn't concede ground.

2. **Reassert your boundary clearly:** “However, when you bring up details from our sessions with others – like a supervisor or my partner – it feels like a breach of that agreement. Even if you believe it’s for my ‘care,’ it’s my right to decide who has access to my private information.”

3. **Explain the impact:** “Sharing these details, even framed as necessary, undermines my trust and makes me hesitant to be fully open with you in the future. It creates a significant barrier to the therapeutic process.”

4. **Reinforce your expectations:** “I need to know that you respect my boundaries around confidentiality. Can you clarify *why* you felt it was necessary to share this information with [supervisor/partner]? And how will you ensure this doesn’t happen again?”

5. **If they continue to push:** "I understand you may be trying to help, but I need to be clear: my privacy is paramount. I’m not comfortable with this level of sharing, and I need to reconsider if we can continue working together."

It's okay to feel uncomfortable and to prioritize your safety and trust.  Let’s work on adapting the script to specifically address this ‘necessary for care’ justification. Would you like to brainstorm some phrases you could use to push back when they try to frame sharing as being in your best interest?
