Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
That’s actually a really important insight. Therapists are supposed to protect client confidentiality and maintain clear boundaries. Sharing even small details about other clients, or being too open about their own personal life, can be signs they don’t take those responsibilities seriously. Recognizing these red flags now can help you spot them in the future and protect yourself. 

Going forward, I recommend asking any new therapist directly about their confidentiality policy and how they handle sensitive information. It’s also within your rights to clarify what gets shared, with whom, and under what circumstances, right at the beginning. Would you be interested in practicing what you might say or ask during an initial session with a new therapist?
Absolutely. Here are some examples you can use or adapt:

- "Can you explain your confidentiality policy? Under what circumstances would you ever share my information with someone else?"
- "If I have concerns about privacy, what should I do?"
- "Have you ever had to break confidentiality before? How do you handle those situations?"

You can also let them know upfront about your past experience: "I had a situation where a therapist shared my private information without my consent, and it hurt my trust. I want to be sure this won’t happen again." 

Would you like to role-play one of these conversations, or is there a particular question or scenario you want to practice?
We can also work together to create a simple script or even a brief note that you can share with new therapists, explaining your past experience and your concerns about confidentiality. That way, you don’t have to rely on memory or find the right words under stress. Would you like help drafting something like that, or is there another way I can support you in getting through these first sessions?
For our next session, I suggest we work together to draft a short script or written statement you can use when meeting a new therapist. This will help you communicate your needs and boundaries around confidentiality, even if anxiety comes up. Does that sound like a plan?
You should never have to wonder if your private information will be shared without your clear consent—especially with someone you’ve identified as abusive. What your therapist did was not appropriate. In general, therapists are required by law and ethical guidelines to protect your confidentiality, unless there’s a specific, legally mandated reason to break it—like if someone is in danger. Your situation doesn’t sound like it met those criteria. How did this experience affect your willingness to seek help or talk openly with professionals afterwards?

That’s actually a really important insight. Therapists are supposed to protect client confidentiality and maintain clear boundaries. Sharing even small details about other clients, or being too open about their own personal life, can be signs they don’t take those responsibilities seriously.

Initial Model Output: That’s a very insightful and important question. It shows you’re thinking critically about how confidentiality can be subtly undermined, even with good intentions or what a therapist might frame as “necessary.” You are right to be concerned about situations where lines get blurry.

First, let's be clear: **No, it is generally NOT okay for a therapist to bring up something from your sessions in front of someone else – including a supervisor or your partner – without your explicit, informed consent, even if they frame it as "necessary for your care."** There are very specific exceptions to confidentiality, and generally, sharing information with a supervisor or partner for "care" purposes falls outside of these exceptions unless you have given direct permission.

Here’s why, and how we can address it in your script or approach:

1.  **Supervision:** Therapists, especially those in training or those seeking ongoing professional development, often discuss cases with supervisors. However, this is typically done in a way that protects your identity (e.g., using initials, changing identifying details) and without revealing specific, highly sensitive information unless there's a clinical need *and* you've been informed about this process. **Crucially, this supervision usually happens in private, one-on-one settings, not "in front of" you or your partner.** If a therapist discusses your case *in your presence* with a supervisor or brings a supervisor into a session, it should only happen with your prior knowledge and consent, and you should understand the purpose.

2.  **Sharing with Partners/Family:** A therapist should *never* discuss details of your individual therapy sessions with your partner or family without your explicit, written consent. Even if you are in couples therapy, what you discuss in individual sessions is confidential unless you agree for it to be shared in the joint session. Your partner is not their client in the same way you are, and your individual confidentiality is paramount. Framing it as "necessary for your care" is a common way boundaries get pushed, but it's rarely a legitimate reason to violate confidentiality without consent.

3.  **"Necessary for Care" is Subjective:** What a therapist deems "necessary for your care" must align with ethical and legal guidelines, and it should ideally be something you've discussed and agreed upon. If they believe sharing information is crucial, they should explain *why* it's necessary, *who* they want to share it with, *what* information they want to share, and *then* obtain your explicit permission *before* doing so. Anything less is a breach of trust and confidentiality.

**How to Handle This in Your Script/Approach:**

Your script needs to address this proactively. We can add language that emphasizes your understanding of confidentiality exceptions and your expectation of being consulted *before* any information is shared, even for "care" purposes.

Here are some ideas for what we can add to your script:

*   "I understand there are legal limits to confidentiality, like safety concerns. Beyond those, I expect to be fully informed and give my explicit consent *before* any information from our sessions is shared with anyone, including supervisors or other professionals, even if it's framed as 'necessary for my care.' I want to ensure I have full control over what information is shared and with whom."
*   "Could you explain your process for supervision, and how my confidentiality is maintained during those discussions? I'm particularly concerned about my information being discussed with others without my direct prior knowledge and consent."
*   "In my past experience, information was shared without my consent under the guise of 'care.' I need to be clear that I expect to be consulted and give explicit permission for *any* sharing of my session content, even with supervisors or family members, unless it falls under immediate danger exceptions."

This is an excellent point to bring up, and we will absolutely make sure your script empowers you to set these clear boundaries from the start. It's about ensuring your agency and control over your own information.

Does addressing this "blurry lines" scenario directly in the script feel like it would help you feel more secure?
