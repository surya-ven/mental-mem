counselor: Hello, thank you for reaching out and for sharing some of your recent experiences. I understand you've gone through a difficult situation involving domestic abuse and a concerning experience with your previous therapist disclosing sensitive information. Before we go further, I want to make sure that our conversations feel comfortable and useful for you. Some people prefer a more direct approach—clear feedback and concrete suggestions—while others prefer a more reflective style, focusing on exploring feelings and understanding experiences together. Which style feels best for you, or do you have another preference?
user: I think I prefer a more direct approach. I want to know what I can do to move forward and make sure nothing like that happens again, both with therapists and in my personal relationships.
counselor: Thank you for sharing your preference. To help us work towards your goals, could you share a bit about what matters most to you right now? For ex...

Initial Model Output: Thank you for asking that important question. It’s a very valid concern, especially given your past experience. You’re right to want to cover situations where confidentiality might feel "blurry" or where a therapist might try to justify sharing information you don't agree with.

Let's clarify this: **In almost all circumstances, a therapist cannot discuss your personal information from sessions with a supervisor or your partner without your explicit, informed consent.**

Here’s why, and what to consider:

1.  **Confidentiality is a cornerstone of therapy.** Your trust in the therapist to keep your information private is essential for effective treatment. This trust is protected by ethical codes and, in most places, by law (e.g., HIPAA in the US).

2.  **Supervision is different from general disclosure.**
    *   **Clinical supervision:** Therapists, especially those in training or those seeking to improve their skills, often discuss cases with a supervisor. However, this is typically done in a way that protects your identity (e.g., using only initials, changing details, or presenting the case without identifying information) and is *for the purpose of the therapist receiving guidance on how best to help you*. The supervisor is also bound by confidentiality. It is **not** about discussing your case with your partner or another third party.
    *   **Consultation:** Similar to supervision, therapists might consult with other professionals (e.g., a psychiatrist for medication questions) to ensure you receive the best care. Again, this is typically done with identity protection and the consultant is also bound by confidentiality.
    *   **In both supervision and consultation, your therapist should ideally inform you that they engage in these practices and explain how your privacy is protected.** Direct discussion of your case with your partner, or any other non-clinical third party, without your *explicit consent* is a breach.

3.  **"Necessary for my care" is not a blanket justification for breaching confidentiality.** There are very few exceptions where confidentiality can be broken without your consent, and these are usually legally mandated situations where there is a clear and imminent danger:
    *   If you pose an immediate threat of serious harm to yourself.
    *   If you pose an immediate threat of serious harm to an identifiable other person.
    *   In cases of suspected child abuse or elder abuse.
    *   If subpoenaed by a court order (though therapists often fight these to protect client privacy).
    *   ***It is NOT an exception to discuss your information with your partner or a general supervisor without your consent, even if they believe it's "necessary for your care."*** If a therapist feels it's necessary for your partner to be involved in your care, they should discuss this with *you first* and get your clear, written permission.

**How to handle this in your script/discussion:**

You can add language to your script that specifically addresses this concern. Here are some options:

*   "I understand that therapists sometimes have supervision or consult with colleagues. Could you explain how you handle confidentiality in those situations, and what information might be shared?"
*   "My past experience makes me very sensitive about my information being shared. Can you assure me that my personal session details will *never* be discussed with anyone outside of legally mandated exceptions, including my partner or even a general supervisor, without my explicit, written consent?"
*   "What is your policy on discussing my case with my partner or family members? I want to be clear that I expect my information to remain confidential unless I specifically give you permission to share it."

This question you've raised is excellent because it helps solidify your understanding of your rights and gives you the tools to set clear boundaries from the start. It empowers you to proactively protect your privacy. Does this clarification help you feel more confident about what to include in your script?
