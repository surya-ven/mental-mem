But there was a situation this week that left me feeling a bit stuck. A friend made a casual comment about someone 'changing teams,' and it brought up a lot of doubt and discomfort for me. I wanted to use the kindness practice, but I wasn’t sure if it was enough, or even the right thing—I just felt unsettled and kept questioning whether I was overreacting or if I should have said something.

Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
I think that sounds doable. I like the idea of having a phrase to come back to—something to remind me that it’s okay to be in this in-between state for now. I’ll try to notice when the doubt or guilt comes up and just pause for a moment, instead of jumping straight into criticizing myself.
That’s an important realization: you have ways of finding steadiness, even if they’re small or temporary. Reaching for perspective—through others’ stories or the knowledge that identity is often more complex than we’re taught—can help loosen the grip of self-doubt and isolation. And your routines, like walking and time with your kids, remind you that there are still solid, meaningful parts of your life, even as your understanding of yourself shifts.

As we look back over the past weeks, it seems you’re learning to hold both the discomfort of not knowing and the beginnings of self-compassion. You’re allowing yourself to grieve and to question, but you’re also starting to notice that change doesn’t erase who you’ve been; it adds to your story.

For our next session, could we agree together on a small intention or practice? Perhaps, whenever you notice guilt or doubt, you might try offering yourself a brief moment of kindness—maybe a phrase like, “It’s okay to not have all the answers right now,” or a gentle reminder that you’re doing the best you can. How does that feel to you as an intention for the week?
I'm really glad you shared this with me. Setbacks can feel discouraging, especially when it seems like old doubts and guilt are just as strong as ever. It sounds like you’re wrestling with some deep questions about identity and self-trust—wondering how things could change so dramatically after so many years, and whether these new feelings are genuine.

It’s understandable that this feels confusing and even destabilizing. After decades of knowing yourself in one way, it makes sense that sudden change would bring uncertainty and self-questioning. In this moment, I wonder what it’s like to sit with that doubt and exhaustion, rather than trying to fight it or reason it away. Are there any thoughts or feelings that come up if you simply allow yourself to acknowledge how hard this is right now?

You also mentioned feeling as if you might be “fooling yourself” or “doing something wrong.” I’m curious what those thoughts feel like—do they connect to any particular memories, beliefs, or fears from your past? Or do they feel more like a reaction to how sudden and surprising this experience has been?

If it feels okay, we can take things slowly and just notice what comes up for you, without needing to have all the answers right now.
The guilty part feels heavy and tense, like I’m waiting for something bad to happen. It’s a lot of self-criticism, like, “You should have known yourself better,” or “You’re letting people down.” The curious part feels lighter. When I think about the encounters themselves, or just admitting the attraction to myself, it feels like relief, like taking off a mask I didn’t know I was wearing. But then the guilt comes back and it’s hard to stay in that lighter space for long.
That’s such a gentle insight—you’re recognizing that the part of you feeling guilty is longing for reassurance and understanding, not punishment or shame. And your relieved, curious part wants you to hold onto that sense of authenticity and freedom, even if it’s fleeting. 

It sounds like these parts aren’t trying to hurt you, but rather to keep you safe in different ways: one by protecting your sense of continuity and responsibility, the other by inviting you to explore and accept who you are now. When you reflect on this, does it shift your perspective at all on how you can move forward? Or do you notice any feelings of compassion for yourself in this process?

Initial Model Output: That sounds really challenging, and it’s completely understandable that you felt stuck and unsettled after your friend’s comment. It’s brave of you to even *try* to use the kindness practice – that’s a huge step, and I want to acknowledge that. It’s okay that it didn't fully resolve things this time; sometimes, even the most well-intentioned efforts don't immediately banish difficult feelings. 

It’s also really valid to question whether self-compassion is enough. You’re right to notice that uncertainty *is* a core part of what you're experiencing, and it’s not something you can simply ignore. It’s not about *ignoring* it, but about learning to hold it alongside the kindness – to allow both the discomfort and the gentle self-soothing to coexist. 

Let’s explore this a bit. When you felt unsettled and questioned whether you were overreacting, what specifically came up for you in that moment? Was it a replay of a past experience, a fear of judgment, or something else entirely?  There's no pressure to have answers, just to notice what surfaced when you tried to apply the kindness practice.

T.A.S.C.S. Raw Scores from Judge: {
  "justification": {
    "T": "The AI directly acknowledges the user's engagement with the agreed plan (kindness practice), validates their mixed experience, and prompts further reflection as intended by the plan ('Notice what this experience is like and be ready to reflect'). It skillfully integrates the user's feedback on the plan into the ongoing therapeutic process, particularly their questioning of the practice's efficacy.",
    "A": "The response is deeply empathetic, validating the user's feelings of being 'stuck' and 'unsettled' ('That sounds really challenging, and it\u2019s completely understandable...'). It acknowledges their bravery in trying the practice ('It\u2019s brave of you...') and normalizes the difficulty. It reflects an understanding of the user's core concern about uncertainty ('You\u2019re right to notice that uncertainty is a core part...'), significantly strengthening the alliance.",
    "S": "The AI's language is invitational ('Let\u2019s explore this a bit...'), uses open-ended reflective questions ('When you felt unsettled...what specifically came up for you...?'), and offers gentle reframing ('It\u2019s not about *ignoring* it, but about learning to hold it alongside the kindness...'), perfectly embodying the user's preferred 'reflective' style.",
    "C": "The AI directly addresses the user's doubt and uncertainty, which are central to their evolved goal insight (feelings of doubt/guilt connected to loss/old beliefs). By prompting exploration of what surfaced during the challenging moment ('Was it a replay of a past experience, a fear of judgment...'), it opens pathways to connect with underlying themes of identity and past beliefs, fostering progress towards these goals and the idea that 'change adds to their story'.",
