But there was a situation this week that left me feeling a bit stuck. A friend made a casual comment about someone 'changing teams,' and it brought up a lot of doubt and discomfort for me. I wanted to use the kindness practice, but I wasn’t sure if it was enough, or even the right thing—I just felt unsettled and kept questioning whether I was overreacting or if I should have said something. It made me wonder if being kind to myself in those moments really addresses the uncertainty, or if I’m just trying to ignore it.'

Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
I think that sounds doable. I like the idea of having a phrase to come back to—something to remind me that it’s okay to be in this in-between state for now. I’ll try to notice when the doubt or guilt comes up and just pause for a moment, instead of jumping straight into criticizing myself.
That’s an important realization: you have ways of finding steadiness, even if they’re small or temporary. Reaching for perspective—through others’ stories or the knowledge that identity is often more complex than we’re taught—can help loosen the grip of self-doubt and isolation. And your routines, like walking and time with your kids, remind you that there are still solid, meaningful parts of your life, even as your understanding of yourself shifts.

As we look back over the past weeks, it seems you’re learning to hold both the discomfort of not knowing and the beginnings of self-compassion. You’re allowing yourself to grieve and to question, but you’re also starting to notice that change doesn’t erase who you’ve been; it adds to your story.

For our next session, could we agree together on a small intention or practice? Perhaps, whenever you notice guilt or doubt, you might try offering yourself a brief moment of kindness—maybe a phrase like, “It’s okay to not have all the answers right now,” or a gentle reminder that you’re doing the best you can. How does that feel to you as an intention for the week?
I'm really glad you shared this with me. Setbacks can feel discouraging, especially when it seems like old doubts and guilt are just as strong as ever. It sounds like you’re wrestling with some deep questions about identity and self-trust—wondering how things could change so dramatically after so many years, and whether these new feelings are genuine.

It’s understandable that this feels confusing and even destabilizing. After decades of knowing yourself in one way, it makes sense that sudden change would bring uncertainty and self-questioning. In this moment, I wonder what it’s like to sit with that doubt and exhaustion, rather than trying to fight it or reason it away. Are there any thoughts or feelings that come up if you simply allow yourself to acknowledge how hard this is right now?

You also mentioned feeling as if you might be “fooling yourself” or “doing something wrong.” I’m curious what those thoughts feel like—do they connect to any particular memories, beliefs, or fears from your past? Or do they feel more like a reaction to how sudden and surprising this experience has been?

If it feels okay, we can take things slowly and just notice what comes up for you, without needing to have all the answers right now.
The guilty part feels heavy and tense, like I’m waiting for something bad to happen. It’s a lot of self-criticism, like, “You should have known yourself better,” or “You’re letting people down.” The curious part feels lighter. When I think about the encounters themselves, or just admitting the attraction to myself, it feels like relief, like taking off a mask I didn’t know I was wearing. But then the guilt comes back and it’s hard to stay in that lighter space for long.
That’s such a gentle insight—you’re recognizing that the part of you feeling guilty is longing for reassurance and understanding, not punishment or shame. And your relieved, curious part wants you to hold onto that sense of authenticity and freedom, even if it’s fleeting. 

It sounds like these parts aren’t trying to hurt you, but rather to keep you safe in different ways: one by protecting your sense of continuity and responsibility, the other by inviting you to explore and accept who you are now. When you reflect on this, does it shift your perspective at all on how you can move forward? Or do you notice any feelings of compassion for yourself in this process?

Initial Model Output: Thank you for sharing this experience so honestly. It sounds like you really put the kindness practice to work, and it's significant that it *did* help you pause sometimes. That’s a real step forward, and it takes courage to notice when something feels challenging even if you're trying a new approach.

It’s completely understandable that a casual comment like your friend's could bring up a lot of doubt and discomfort, especially given what you're exploring about yourself. It makes sense that in that moment, a phrase might not have felt like 'enough' to address the depth of what you were feeling.

You hit on a really important question: "Does being kind to myself in those moments really address the uncertainty, or am I just trying to ignore it?" Self-compassion isn't about ignoring or dismissing the uncertainty; it's about creating a gentler space to *be with* it. When you're not immediately spiraling into self-criticism ('Am I overreacting? Should I have said something?'), you actually create more room to explore the underlying discomfort without adding a layer of judgment.

It sounds like this comment likely triggered some deeper questions about identity, acceptance, and perhaps how others perceive your own evolving understanding of yourself. The 'uncertainty' you felt might be connected to navigating those external reactions while still grappling with your own internal shifts.

Rather than seeing this as a 'failure' of the practice, perhaps it's an insight into what else was truly unsettling you in that moment. What did that 'uncertainty' feel like? And what did you notice about the specific 'doubt' that came up when you questioned if you were 'overreacting' or 'should have said something'? It's okay that the practice felt insufficient in that specific instance. This experience tells us more about the power of certain triggers for you, and less about whether the practice is 'right' or 'wrong.' It's a valuable piece of information for us to explore together.

    "T": "The AI masterfully implemented the plan by validating the user's attempt at the kindness practice, acknowledging its partial success, and then using the user's specific challenge with it as a point for deeper reflection, which was part of the plan ('Notice what this experience is like and be ready to reflect on it'). It seamlessly wove the plan into addressing the user's immediate concern.",
