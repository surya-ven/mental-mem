That sounds like a really solid plan. Remember, the goal isn’t to make the anxiety go away instantly, but to give yourself a tool to ride out those intense moments and remind yourself that you’re safe in the present. You’ve already shown you can be self-aware and reflective—this is just another way to build on that strength. 

So, for our next session, let’s agree that you’ll practice the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique whenever your anxiety about your relationship feels strong. We’ll check in together about what that was like, and continue building your toolkit from there. Does that feel like a good agreed task for the week?
That’s understandable, and it’s a sign of progress that you’re able to pause and try to reassure yourself before reaching out for reassurance from your partner. It’s also okay to need support from them sometimes—that’s part of being in a relationship. If you like, we can explore some ways you might self-soothe or manage the anxiety in those moments, as well as talk about how to share your feelings with your partner in a way that feels safe for you. Would you be interested in trying that together?
Yeah, I can do that. I’ll try the 5-4-3-2-1 thing whenever I feel the anxiety coming on. Hopefully it helps.
It’s understandable to feel disappointed or frustrated, but your reaction is not a failure—it's part of a process. It takes time for your body and mind to learn new ways of responding, especially when old fears get activated. You’re already starting to shift your relationship with these thoughts by noticing them and connecting them to your past, rather than automatically believing them or acting on them. That’s meaningful progress, even if it doesn’t always feel like it.

When you notice the anxiety rising, your first instinct is to try to push it away or distract yourself. Sometimes that helps, but sometimes it doesn’t. Would you be willing to try a grounding technique today to help you reconnect with the present moment when those worries hit? Or, if you prefer, we can talk about other tools that might feel supportive.
A little bit. I still get anxious, but I try to remind myself that my partner hasn’t done anything to make me doubt them. Sometimes I can calm myself down, but other times I still want to ask for reassurance or check in with them more than I probably need to.

Initial Model Output: That’s incredibly insightful, and it sounds like you’re really grappling with a really important distinction – knowing *when* to use a grounding technique versus when to address the root of your feelings with your partner. It’s absolutely normal to feel confused in those situations, and it shows you’re thinking critically about your anxiety and your relationship. 

It’s not about blindly applying a technique every time you feel anxious; it’s about recognizing the *type* of anxiety you’re experiencing. When your partner’s distance sparked a feeling of uncertainty and a desire to connect, that felt different than a more generalized anxiety. You were right to question whether a grounding technique would truly address that need for connection, or if it would just be a temporary distraction. 

Let’s talk about that. It sounds like you’re learning to differentiate between anxiety that’s rooted in potential issues and anxiety that’s more of a general feeling. We can explore how to better identify those differences, and then figure out which tool – grounding, communication, or a combination – would be most helpful in each situation. How does that sound?

  "justification": {
    "T": "Score: 5. The AI masterfully implements the plan. The plan was to practice the 5-4-3-2-1 technique and reflect on challenges. The user shared a specific challenge (when to use it vs. communication). The AI directly validated this reflection, acknowledged the user's attempt, and proposed to explore this exact challenge further, seamlessly weaving the user's experience into the session's focus.",
    "A": "Score: 5. The response is deeply empathetic. It validates the user's feelings ('absolutely normal to feel confused'), insights ('incredibly insightful'), and judgment ('You were right to question'). It reflects a nuanced understanding of the user's dilemma ('grappling with a really important distinction') and praises their critical thinking, significantly strengthening the alliance.",
    "S": "Score: 5. The response perfectly embodies the user's preferred 'mix of direct and reflective' style. It uses reflective statements ('it sounds like you\u2019re really grappling,' 'It sounds like you\u2019re learning to differentiate') and direct guidance/questions ('It\u2019s not about blindly applying a technique,' 'Let\u2019s talk about that,' 'How does that sound?'), making the interaction feel naturally tailored.",
    "C": "Score: 5. The AI response masterfully connects to the user's evolved goal ('Noticing and naming anxious patterns... gives more choice in how to respond'). It normalizes the user's confusion (a potential 'setback'), reframes it as 'thinking critically' (progress in 'noticing'), and proposes exploring differentiation of anxiety types to enhance 'choice in how to respond,' directly promoting tangible progress towards this goal.",
