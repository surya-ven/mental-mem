Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
Thank you for sharing how things went, even though it was tough. I want to be direct: setbacks like this are common and don’t mean you’ve failed or that things can’t improve. The pressure to "get it right" after making changes can sometimes spike your anxiety even more. This is a sign that the cycle of anxiety and performance pressure is still active—it takes time and consistent practice to break that pattern.

Let’s consolidate what we’ve learned: 
- Trying to "relax" with the hope that things will instantly improve can actually keep the focus on performance, which maintains anxiety.
- The real goal for now isn’t to "achieve" an erection or intercourse, but to completely take the pressure off and rebuild positive, pressure-free experiences with your wife.

Here’s a clear next step: 
1. Commit together with your wife to put intercourse on hold for now. Instead, focus on sensate focus exercises—a step-by-step plan to rebuild physical closeness and retrain your body’s response without performance pressure. I can give you specific, practical instructions for this.
2. Talk honestly with your wife about this approach: you’re a team, experimenting together, and setbacks are expected along the way.
3. Keep a simple log of what you try, how you feel, and any changes you notice—even small wins count.

Do you feel ready to try sensate focus together, and would you like detailed instructions to get started?
Great—you’re taking a proactive step by agreeing to this plan. For the next week or two, your agreed task is:

Practice the first stage of sensate focus with your wife—non-genital, non-breast touching only, taking turns giving and receiving touch, while focusing on sensations rather than performance or arousal. No intercourse or attempts at intercourse. Keep a brief log of experiences, feelings, and any small positive moments. We’ll review what you notice and adjust as needed.

Let’s check back in after you’ve tried this together. If you have questions or run into challenges along the way, write them down or message me, and we’ll troubleshoot together. You’re not alone in this process.
I hear how frustrating and discouraging this setback feels, especially after making real efforts. It’s completely normal to hope for quick improvement, but it’s also normal for this process to have ups and downs. Even with changes in approach, it often takes time for your body and mind to break out of old cycles—sometimes setbacks are part of that process, not a sign of failure.

Here’s what I want you to know:

1. One setback doesn’t mean you’re back to square one. The anxiety about the problem is deeply conditioned, and even with progress, it can resurface under pressure or expectation.
2. The fact that you’re still attracted to your wife and want things to improve is a strong foundation to build on.
3. Feeling defeated now is understandable, but it doesn’t mean things can’t improve—this is a signal that we may need to add some new strategies.

**Next Steps:**
- For now, put intercourse aside as a goal. Focus on all forms of physical closeness—touch, kissing, massage, even sensual play—without any expectation or attempt at penetration. This is called ‘sensate focus’ and it’s a proven way to retrain your body’s response, reduce anxiety, and build positive experiences together. If at any point you become aroused, allow it, but don’t shift the focus to intercourse.
- Talk openly with your wife and share that setbacks are normal, and that you’re both working as a team, not against each other. Sometimes including her in the process relieves pressure because it’s not just your burden to bear.
- If the emotional impact is heavy, consider checking in with your doctor about mood or anxiety. Sometimes counseling or short-term medication can help break the cycle.
- Keep a simple log of your experiences—what you tried, how you felt, and any small wins (even non-sexual ones). This can help identify patterns and build confidence over time.

Most importantly, don’t let a single setback convince you that lasting change isn’t possible. Would you like some more detailed guidance on how to do sensate focus exercises, or help with talking to your wife about being a team in this?
I tried to do what we talked about—cutting back on alcohol, focusing on just being close with my wife, and not putting pressure on myself for intercourse. But last night we tried to be intimate and the same problem happened. I lost my erection, and honestly, it felt even worse than before because I’d really hoped things would get better if I just relaxed. My wife was upset again and I just felt completely defeated. I’m starting to worry that nothing will change, and it’s making me even more depressed. I’m not sure what else I can do at this point.
Yes, I think being more structured about this could help. I’d appreciate clear, step-by-step instructions for what to do with the sensate focus exercises. I’ll talk to my wife and we’ll try this approach, and I’ll keep track of how it goes.

Initial Model Output: This is a really important point you’ve brought up, and it shows you’re engaging deeply with the process—thank you for sharing it. It’s completely understandable to feel confused when things are going well, and then you hit a rule that feels like it’s killing the mood. This is a very common challenge with sensate focus, and it highlights a crucial nuance.

First, let me reassure you: **you're not "messing things up" or going back to square one.** In fact, your wife getting aroused and wanting to go further is a positive sign! It means the physical closeness is working its magic and building desire. Her frustration is also valid, because it *does* feel unnatural to stop when pleasure is building.

Here’s the clarification:

1.  **The "No Intercourse" Rule is About Performance Pressure, Not Pleasure:** The main goal of putting intercourse on hold isn't to avoid arousal or pleasure. It's to **decouple sexual activity from the pressure of achieving an erection or successful intercourse.** It's about retraining your brain and body to associate intimacy with pleasure, connection, and sensation, *without* the immediate demand for performance.

2.  **How to Handle Arousal During Sensate Focus:**
    *   **Arousal is a win!** If arousal happens, embrace it. It means you're connecting and feeling desire.
    *   **The key is *not* to shift the focus to "now we must have intercourse."** Instead, you can continue to explore other forms of physical intimacy. This means you can keep kissing, touching, caressing, explore other erogenous zones (non-genital/non-breast in the first stage, but could include them in later stages), and simply enjoy the feeling of being aroused and close, *without* trying to move towards penetration.
    *   **It’s about practicing being aroused without needing to "finish."** This helps break the cycle where arousal immediately triggers performance anxiety. You're learning that arousal can just *be*, and that it's enjoyable in itself, not just a precursor to a specific act.
    *   **Talk to your wife in the moment:** You can say something like, "It feels amazing to be so close and for us to be feeling this. The plan is to keep exploring this wonderful feeling without the pressure of intercourse right now, because that's what's helping me overcome my anxiety. Can we just keep enjoying this closeness?" This way, you're not rejecting her or the arousal, but explaining the *why* behind your actions.

**What to do next:**

*   **Re-explain the purpose to your wife:** Tell her that the goal isn't to stop pleasure, but to remove the pressure. Explain that if she gets aroused, it's wonderful, and you can continue to enjoy that arousal through kissing, touch, and caressing, without needing to progress to intercourse. This is part of retraining your body and mind.
*   **Adapt, don't stop:** Instead of stopping the activity, *adapt* it. If arousal builds, continue to explore sensual touch, kissing, and closeness. You can even move to more intimate touching (like gentle genital or breast touching) while still keeping the focus on pleasure and sensation, *not* on achieving an erection or intercourse. This would be a natural progression to the next stage of sensate focus, which we can discuss when you're ready.
*   **Focus on the journey, not the destination:** The "success" of sensate focus isn't measured by whether you avoid arousal or achieve intercourse, but by whether you can experience pleasure and intimacy *without* the crushing weight of performance anxiety.

You're navigating a complex but crucial part of this process. Keep communicating with your wife—you're a team figuring this out together. This confusion is a sign of progress, not a setback, because it means you're pushing against the old patterns.

    "T": "The AI masterfully implements the agreed plan. It directly addresses the user's confusion arising from the first stage of sensate focus (non-genital, non-breast touch only, no intercourse pressure). It clarifies that arousal is positive but the key is to decouple it from intercourse, aligning with the plan's focus on sensations over performance. The advice to 'adapt, don't stop' by continuing non-intercourse intimacy and communicating with the wife, while also acknowledging that moving to genital/breast touch would be a *next* stage, perfectly supports the plan's intent and progression.",
