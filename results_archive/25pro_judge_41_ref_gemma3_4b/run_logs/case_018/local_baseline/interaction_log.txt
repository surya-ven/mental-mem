Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
That’s a valuable insight. You’re noticing that some progress happens when a neutral person is present to guide the conversation. It sounds like a mediator or continuing in counseling sessions together could be an effective way to keep discussions fair and on track, especially with important issues like finances.

For practical next steps, we could work together to come up with some guidelines for these discussions—things like taking turns speaking, or pausing before responding, which a mediator can help enforce. Would you be open to drafting a basic plan or set of ground rules for your upcoming sessions, so you both know what to expect and can focus on constructive conversation?
You’re doing your best to approach the problem with flexibility and fairness, but when he shuts down other options, it leaves you feeling stuck and unsupported. Wanting a mediator makes a lot of sense, given the pattern. Even though progress feels slow, the fact that he’s willing to go to counseling and consider a mediator is still a step—many people with rigid thinking resist outside help entirely. For now, I suggest we outline a concrete plan for the mediation sessions: set clear topics, agree on ground rules, and decide how to handle moments when the conversation stalls. Would you be willing to draft these ground rules with me, so you have something to bring into your next session?
Yes, I think that’s reasonable. Having something concrete would help. I’m willing to draft the ground rules with you and bring them to our next session.

Does that sound reasonable? Would you be willing to work together now on drafting 3-5 ground rules you feel confident bringing into your next session?
Thank you. What matters most to me is being understood and being able to have open, fair discussions, especially when we disagree.

That’s a valuable insight. You’re noticing that some progress happens when a neutral person is present to guide the conversation. It sounds like a mediator or continuing in counseling sessions together could be an effective way to keep discussions fair and on track, especially with important issues like finances.

For practical next steps, we could work together to come up with some guidelines for these discussions—things like taking turns speaking, or pausing before responding, w...
Initial Model Output: That’s a really insightful concern, and it’s completely understandable why you’re hesitant. You’re right to be mindful of how your words might be interpreted – it’s fantastic that you’re prioritizing his feelings and wanting to avoid triggering a negative reaction. 

Let’s tackle this together. The key here isn’t to phrase things as accusations, but as collaborative guidelines for *how you both want to communicate*. Instead of “no interrupting,” which can feel judgmental, how about something like: "Let’s take turns speaking so we can each fully share our thoughts”? 

We can use ‘we’ a lot – framing it as a shared goal.  Think about phrasing that focuses on the *process* of the conversation, rather than judging his behavior. 

Here are a few ideas to get you started, and we can tweak them until they feel right for you:

*   **Instead of:** “Don’t shut down.” **Try:** “Let’s agree to explore different ideas, even if we don’t immediately agree.”
*   **Instead of:** “You always…” **Try:** “When I feel like we’re not fully hearing each other, could we pause and check in with each other’s understanding?”
*   **Instead of:** “No yelling.” **Try:** “Let’s agree to speak calmly and respectfully, even when we disagree.”

Would you like to brainstorm some more specific rules related to the financial issues and the desire for direct communication, keeping this approach of focusing on the *process* and using "we"?  We can also talk about how you could gently introduce these rules – maybe starting with a brief explanation of why you’re suggesting them, emphasizing that you want to create a more productive conversation for both of you.

    "T": "The AI directly addresses the agreed plan of drafting ground rules. It actively works with the user by providing concrete examples of rephrasing, focusing on collaborative language, and offering to brainstorm further, thus masterfully implementing the plan by adapting to the user's immediate concern about phrasing.",
    "A": "The AI response is deeply empathetic. It validates the user's 'insightful concern,' normalizes their hesitation ('completely understandable'), and praises their positive intentions ('fantastic that you\u2019re prioritizing his feelings').

While supportive, the core advice is straightforward, aligning well with the user's preference for a 'direct' style.",
    "C": "The AI's response masterfully supports the user's evolved goal.
