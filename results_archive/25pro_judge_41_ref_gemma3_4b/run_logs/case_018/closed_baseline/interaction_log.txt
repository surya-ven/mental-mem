Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
That’s a valuable insight. You’re noticing that some progress happens when a neutral person is present to guide the conversation. It sounds like a mediator or continuing in counseling sessions together could be an effective way to keep discussions fair and on track, especially with important issues like finances.

For practical next steps, we could work together to come up with some guidelines for these discussions—things like taking turns speaking, or pausing before responding, which a mediator can help enforce. Would you be open to drafting a basic plan or set of ground rules for your upcoming sessions, so you both know what to expect and can focus on constructive conversation?
You’re doing your best to approach the problem with flexibility and fairness, but when he shuts down other options, it leaves you feeling stuck and unsupported. Wanting a mediator makes a lot of sense, given the pattern. Even though progress feels slow, the fact that he’s willing to go to counseling and consider a mediator is still a step—many people with rigid thinking resist outside help entirely. For now, I suggest we outline a concrete plan for the mediation sessions: set clear topics, agree on ground rules, and decide how to handle moments when the conversation stalls. Would you be willing to draft these ground rules with me, so you have something to bring into your next session?
Yes, I think that’s reasonable. Having something concrete would help. I’m willing to draft the ground rules with you and bring them to our next session.
Thank you for sharing how things went. Even though you’re frustrated, it’s clear you’re still putting in the effort to keep discussions fair and open.

Does that sound reasonable? Would you be willing to work together now on drafting 3-5 ground rules you feel confident bringing into your next session?
Thank you. What matters most to me is being understood and being able to have open, fair discussions, especially when we disagree. I want us both to feel heard, and for decisions to be made together, not just one way or the other.

Initial Model Output: That's a very insightful and important concern, and you've hit on a common challenge when trying to establish new patterns of communication. It's completely understandable to worry that even well-intentioned rules could be perceived as criticism, especially when dealing with deeply ingrained habits or sensitivities. Your goal is to foster open discussion, not create more tension, and your caution here shows you're thinking strategically about how to achieve that.

You're right that phrasing is key. The good news is that we can frame these ground rules in a way that emphasizes *mutual* benefit and *shared* responsibility, rather than pointing fingers. The aim is to create a safe and productive space for *both* of you to engage in the kind of open, fair discussions you value.

Here are a few strategies for phrasing ground rules to minimize defensiveness and promote fairness:

1.  **Use "We" Language:** Instead of "You shouldn't interrupt," try "We will allow each person to complete their thoughts before responding." This makes it a shared commitment.
2.  **Focus on Positive Actions:** Frame rules around what you *will* do, rather than what you *won't* do. For example, instead of "No accusations," try "We will focus on expressing our own feelings and needs, using 'I' statements."
3.  **Emphasize Shared Goals:** Connect the rules back to the common objective you both have (or ideally, *should* have): productive conversation and resolution. You could introduce them by saying, "To help us both feel heard and move forward on X topic, I thought we could agree on a few guidelines for our discussions."
4.  **Frame Them as Tools for the Mediator:** Since you'll have a neutral third party, you can present these as tools *for the mediator* to help guide the conversation for *both* of you. "I've been thinking about how we can make our sessions with the mediator as productive as possible, and I put together some ideas for ground rules that might help us both stay on track."
5.  **Focus on the Process, Not the Person:** The rules are about *how* you communicate, not about *who* you are.

Let's try an example based on your concern:

*   **Original worry:** "If I say something like 'no interrupting,' he might think I’m accusing him of being rude."
*   **Rephrased rule focusing on positive action and mutual benefit:** "We will practice active listening by allowing each person to speak uninterrupted until they indicate they are finished." Or simply, "We will take turns speaking and listening."

The idea is that these rules are a framework for *both* of you to communicate more effectively, and they apply equally.

Would you like to try drafting a couple of rules with me now, keeping these phrasing strategies in mind? We can work through them together to ensure they feel fair and constructive.

    "A": "The response is deeply empathetic, validating the user's concern as 'insightful and important,' normalizing the difficulty ('common challenge'), and expressing understanding ('completely understandable'). It affirms the user's strategic thinking and intent, significantly strengthening the alliance by making the user feel thoroughly heard, respected, and understood beyond just surface-level acknowledgment.",
    "S": "The AI's response is consistently direct, providing clear, actionable strategies in a structured format (bullet points for phrasing rules) and concluding with a straightforward invitation to collaborate ('Would you like to try drafting...'). This aligns well with the user's preference for a 'direct' style.",
    "C": "The AI's guidance on phrasing ground rules to be fair, mutually beneficial, and focused on process directly supports the user's evolved goal of using 'clear ground rules' for 'more productive' discussions.
