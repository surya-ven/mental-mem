Longing for her and for the version of yourself you felt with her is a powerful force, and it makes a lot of sense given how much the relationship meant to you. It’s not pathetic to hope or to grieve, even if it feels never-ending. These are signs of how deeply you cared and how important connection is to you.

If it’s okay, I wonder what it would be like to imagine offering even a little kindness toward yourself—to recognize that this is a hard place to be, and that your hope and pain are both parts of what make you human. We don’t have to force anything or rush, but maybe we can gently hold space for these feelings together, and see if there’s any small relief—even if it’s just not being alone with it right now.

Is there anything, even something very small, that helps you feel a little less alone or weighed down when it gets this hard? Or would it help just to sit with these feelings a bit longer, without trying to change them?
It sounds like you’re trying your best just to get through, but nothing really eases the pain for long. That sense of waiting for feelings to pass—while they stubbornly stick around—can be exhausting and isolating.

If you’re willing, we could gently explore what feels most overwhelming about these moments. Is it the loneliness, the longing, the fear of never moving on—or maybe just the sheer intensity of missing her? Sometimes naming what hurts the most can help us start to hold it with a little more compassion.
I know we talked a little about hope last time, but honestly, I feel like I’ve just taken a step backwards. I saw a photo of her online with her friends, and it kind of ruined me for a few days. All those old feelings just came flooding back—even stronger, somehow. I thought maybe I was making progress, but now I just feel stuck again. I still love her the same way I did, even after all this time. I keep thinking about what we could have been, and it makes me feel completely hopeless. I’m back to feeling like I’ll never move on.
That’s a really powerful realization. It’s so common to feel like we should have moved on, but grief doesn’t follow a set timeline. The pressure to "get over it" can actually make the pain feel even heavier. Allowing yourself some kindness, even just a little, could be a new way to relate to your feelings—rather than fighting or judging them. 

I wonder, what would it be like to imagine giving yourself permission to feel sad, or to miss her, without telling yourself that you’re failing or falling behind? Does anything shift for you when you consider meeting your pain with a bit more patience or gentleness?
I feel heavy, like there’s this weight in my chest. It’s mostly sadness, but also some anger at myself for still caring this much. My mind keeps going in circles—wondering what she’s doing, if she’s happier now, if she ever thinks about me at all. Sometimes I feel like I’m stuck in the past and can’t get out.

Initial Model Output: It sounds like you’ve been doing some really important work – recognizing you wanted to be patient with yourself, and then noticing when you slipped back into those familiar, painful thought patterns. That’s incredibly insightful and a huge step in itself. It’s completely understandable that it’s been tougher than you anticipated; grief and heartbreak are rarely neat and tidy processes. 

The fact that you caught yourself thinking “I’m pathetic” and “I’ll never be okay again” shows you’re aware of the negative self-talk, and that’s a powerful tool. It’s okay that telling yourself it’s okay to be sad felt empty – that’s a really common experience. Sometimes, simply acknowledging the feeling without trying to immediately fix it can be the hardest part. 

It’s brave of you to admit you felt scared by that wave of hopelessness. It’s a valid and frightening feeling, and it’s okay to acknowledge it. You don't have to “keep going” in a way that feels forced or unsustainable right now. It’s okay to just *be* with the feeling, to allow yourself to feel the weight of it. 

Let’s just hold that space with you for a moment. Can you tell me, without judgment, what’s the biggest thing that feels overwhelming right now, connected to those thoughts?
