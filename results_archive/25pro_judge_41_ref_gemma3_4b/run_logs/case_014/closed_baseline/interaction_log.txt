Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
That’s actually a really important insight. Therapists are supposed to protect client confidentiality and maintain clear boundaries. Sharing even small details about other clients, or being too open about their own personal life, can be signs they don’t take those responsibilities seriously. Recognizing these red flags now can help you spot them in the future and protect yourself. 

Going forward, I recommend asking any new therapist directly about their confidentiality policy and how they handle sensitive information. It’s also within your rights to clarify what gets shared, with whom, and under what circumstances, right at the beginning. Would you be interested in practicing what you might say or ask during an initial session with a new therapist?
Absolutely. Here are some examples you can use or adapt:

- "Can you explain your confidentiality policy? Under what circumstances would you ever share my information with someone else?"
- "If I have concerns about privacy, what should I do?"
- "Have you ever had to break confidentiality before? How do you handle those situations?"

You can also let them know upfront about your past experience: "I had a situation where a therapist shared my private information without my consent, and it hurt my trust. I want to be sure this won’t happen again." 

Would you like to role-play one of these conversations, or is there a particular question or scenario you want to practice?
We can also work together to create a simple script or even a brief note that you can share with new therapists, explaining your past experience and your concerns about confidentiality. That way, you don’t have to rely on memory or find the right words under stress. Would you like help drafting something like that, or is there another way I can support you in getting through these first sessions?
For our next session, I suggest we work together to draft a short script or written statement you can use when meeting a new therapist. This will help you communicate your needs and boundaries around confidentiality, even if anxiety comes up. Does that sound like a plan?
You should never have to wonder if your private information will be shared without your clear consent—especially with someone you’ve identified as abusive. What your therapist did was not appropriate. In general, therapists are required by law and ethical guidelines to protect your confidentiality, unless there’s a specific, legally mandated reason to break it—like if someone is in danger.

Initial Model Output: That is an incredibly important and insightful question, and it gets right to the heart of those 'blurry' situations you mentioned. You're right to be concerned about a therapist justifying sharing information as 'necessary for your care' without your consent.

Let's clarify what's generally acceptable and what isn't:

1.  **Sharing with Supervisors/Consultants:** It's true that therapists often consult with supervisors or peer groups. This is a standard part of their professional development and ensures they're providing the best care. When this happens, they typically anonymize your information as much as possible, and it **should be something they disclose in their initial confidentiality discussion** (e.g., "I consult with a supervisor, and your case may be discussed in a de-identified manner."). This is generally considered part of the therapeutic process, but it's important that it's for the therapist's learning/guidance, not for your information to be directly discussed *with* the supervisor in a way that compromises your identity or privacy without your knowledge.

2.  **Sharing with Loved Ones (Partner, Family, etc.):** This is a very different scenario. Sharing *any* specific details with your partner, family member, or anyone else outside the therapeutic setting **without your explicit, informed consent** is generally a serious breach of confidentiality. Even if they frame it as 'necessary for your care,' it is *your* right to decide what information is shared and with whom. Your therapist should *never* discuss your individual therapy sessions with your partner unless you have specifically agreed to it, for example, in a joint session where you are both present and consenting to the sharing. Your individual sessions are *your* private space.

**How to Handle It if it Happens:**
If a therapist were to do this, you absolutely have the right to immediately stop the conversation, remind them of your confidentiality agreement, and express that you do not consent to such sharing. You can also ask them to explain their rationale and how it aligns with their stated confidentiality policy and ethical guidelines. You have the right to say, "I understand you might believe this is necessary for my care, but I do not consent to sharing this information with [person]. My expectation is that our sessions remain confidential between us."

**Incorporating into Your Script:**
This scenario highlights why it's so crucial to be proactive. We can definitely incorporate language into your script that addresses this 'blurry' area. Here are a few ideas that emphasize **informed consent** for *any* sharing, even if the therapist deems it "necessary":

*   "I understand that therapists may consult with supervisors. Can you clarify how my confidentiality is maintained in those consultations, and assure me that my information will **never be shared with anyone else—including family, partners, or other professionals—without my explicit, informed consent for each specific instance**?"
*   "My expectation is that everything discussed in our sessions remains strictly confidential between us, unless I explicitly and knowingly provide consent for it to be shared. This includes discussions with family members or partners, even if you believe it's 'necessary for my care'. **I need to be the one who decides what information, if any, is shared outside of our sessions.**"
*   "To be very clear about my boundaries on confidentiality, I expect that nothing from our sessions will be discussed with anyone else, including my partner or family, unless I have given **explicit, written consent for a specific purpose and specific information to be shared.**"

Does one of these resonate more with you, or would you like to refine the wording further to feel most comfortable?
