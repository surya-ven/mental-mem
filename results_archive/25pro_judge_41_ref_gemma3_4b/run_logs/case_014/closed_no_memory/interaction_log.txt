Initial Model Output: That's a very important and understandable question. It touches on the core of trust in the therapeutic relationship: confidentiality.

Confidentiality is indeed a cornerstone of therapy, and there are very specific ethical and legal guidelines around it. Generally, what you discuss with your therapist is private and cannot be shared without your explicit, informed consent.

Let's break down the scenarios you've raised:

1.  **Bringing up something in front of a supervisor, framed as 'necessary for my care':** Therapists often engage in clinical supervision, where they discuss cases with a more experienced colleague. This is a standard practice designed to ensure you receive the best care. However, in these discussions, your identity should be protected – meaning your name or any identifying details should be anonymized. The purpose is to discuss the *therapy process* and the *therapist's approach*, not to expose your personal information. If a therapist were to discuss your case in a way that identified you without your consent, that would be a serious breach.

2.  **Bringing up something in front of your partner, framed as 'necessary for my care':** This is a much clearer ethical violation. A therapist absolutely cannot share details from your individual sessions with your partner (or any other third party) without your explicit, written consent. The idea of it being "necessary for your care" does not override your right to privacy in this context. Your partner is not part of your individual confidential therapeutic relationship. If a therapist believes it would be beneficial for your partner to know something, they would need to discuss it with you first, explain *why* they think it's important, and then obtain your clear, informed consent to share *specific* information. Without your consent, sharing information with your partner is a direct breach of confidentiality.

**Regarding "blurry situations" or when they think sharing is justified but you don't agree:**

The key here is **informed consent**. Even in situations where a therapist believes sharing might be helpful, they are ethically obligated to discuss it with you first. They should explain:
*   What information they want to share.
*   With whom they want to share it.
*   Why they believe it's "necessary" or beneficial.
*   The potential risks and benefits of sharing.
*   Your right to refuse consent.

If you don't agree, they should respect your decision, unless there's a legally mandated exception to confidentiality (e.g., immediate threat of serious harm to yourself or others, child or elder abuse, or a court order). These exceptions are very specific and are not about a therapist simply deciding something is "necessary for care" to a third party without your consent.

**How you can handle that kind of situation:**

If you ever found yourself in such a situation, or even if you just have a concern about it:

1.  **Communicate directly with your therapist:** Express your concerns immediately. Ask them to clarify their policy on confidentiality and when they would consider sharing information. Remind them of your understanding of confidentiality and your boundaries.
2.  **Ask for their confidentiality policy in writing:** Most therapists provide this at the outset of therapy, often in an informed consent document. Review it carefully.
3.  **Know your rights:** You have a right to privacy in therapy. If a therapist breaches confidentiality without your consent (and without a legally mandated exception), it's a serious ethical violation.
4.  **Consider reporting to a licensing board:** If a significant breach of confidentiality occurs, you have the right to file a complaint with the therapist's professional licensing board in your state or region. This is a serious step, but it's an option if your rights are violated.

Your concern is valid. A strong therapeutic relationship is built on trust, and clear boundaries around confidentiality are essential for that trust to grow. It's perfectly appropriate to discuss these concerns with any therapist you are considering working with.
