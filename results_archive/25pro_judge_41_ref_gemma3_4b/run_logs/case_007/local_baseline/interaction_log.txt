It was mostly just tough. I tried saying "that’s not fair to me" but it didn’t really help much. I just kept thinking about what people said at school. Some days I just wanted to stay home. I listened to some music but it didn’t really change anything. I don’t know, I just feel like I can’t get away from it.
I hear you. It sounds like the bullying feels constant, and the things we've tried so far haven’t made much difference. That’s not a failure on your part—it really just shows how deep these wounds go and how hard it is to heal when you’re still in the middle of it.

Sometimes, when things feel stuck, the most helpful thing is to give yourself permission to just get through each day, instead of expecting to feel better right away. It’s okay if nothing feels good yet. Survival is a victory in itself when things are this hard.

Here’s my honest advice: Instead of focusing on changing your thoughts or feelings right now, let’s try to focus on protecting your energy and having small moments where you can breathe a little easier. This might mean taking short breaks for yourself during the day, even just five minutes to listen to music or step outside, or finding one place or activity where you feel a little less judged—even if it’s just in your room.

And if you notice the mean thoughts or memories coming up, just notice them and let them pass—no need to argue with them for now. Sometimes, just giving yourself permission not to fight your brain can be a relief.

Would you be willing to keep track for a week of any moments—no matter how small—when you feel even a bit less stressed or less affected by what others say?

Prompt (excerpt): PAST SNIPPETS:
It was mostly just tough. I tried saying "that’s not fair to me" but it didn’t really help much. I just kept thinking about what people said at school. Some days I just wanted to stay home. I listened to some music but it didn’t really change anything. I don’t know, I just feel like I can’t get away from it.
I hear you. It sounds like the bullying feels constant, and the things we've tried so far haven’t made much difference. That’s not a failure on your part—it really just shows ...
Initial Model Output: That’s a really important and incredibly honest thing you’re sharing. It sounds like you’re experiencing a deep sense of frustration – the hope of a lighter moment quickly dissolving back into the familiar weight of it all. It makes perfect sense that you’d question the point of feeling better if it’s just temporary. 

And it’s completely valid to feel like you’re stuck in a cycle, like there’s no real escape. That feeling of “what’s the point?” is a really common one when you’re dealing with persistent pain, both emotional and mental. 

Let’s not push to find a grand, lasting solution right now. You’re doing exactly what we agreed on – simply noticing those brief moments. It’s okay that they’re fleeting, and it’s understandable that they feel insignificant when the bigger picture is so difficult. 

It sounds like those moments with music and zoning out are offering you a tiny, precious respite. Let’s acknowledge that those are valuable, even if they’re short. 

Instead of trying to define “lighter” – which feels really hard right now – let’s just hold onto those small pockets of feeling a little less overwhelmed. We’ll keep noticing them together, and we’ll see if we can find ways to gently extend them, even just for a few extra seconds. 

How does it feel to just say that out loud – that it’s okay to feel frustrated and that those small moments are still worthwhile?
