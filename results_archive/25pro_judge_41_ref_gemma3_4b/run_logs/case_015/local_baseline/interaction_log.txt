Exactly, and that’s a key insight. When we’re overwhelmed, it’s hard to recognize our own patterns in the moment. The goal isn’t to avoid stress completely, but to catch yourself earlier—maybe when you notice that freeze-up or see your to-do list getting out of control. That’s the point where you can try something different, like pausing to prioritize or reaching out for support. Would you be open to practicing that this week—specifically, noticing the first signs of overwhelm and trying a small intervention, like pausing for five minutes to list priorities or sending a quick check-in to your manager?
Great. Let’s agree that your task for this week is to watch for early signs of overwhelm at work and, when you notice them, deliberately pause—just for a few minutes—to assess your priorities or check in with your manager about what’s most urgent. We’ll review how it goes next time. Does that sound like a clear plan?
Yes, that sounds clear. I’ll make a note to pause and check in with myself and my manager if things get overwhelming.
I had a couple of big deadlines, and my manager kept adding more tasks. I tried to manage my time, but everything kept piling up. I felt overwhelmed and didn’t really know what to do, so I just kept working instead of trying to problem-solve. Now I’m worried I’m back at square one.
Thank you for breaking that down. This kind of pattern—feeling overwhelmed and then powering through—is really common when stress gets high. It makes sense that you’d freeze up when the workload felt impossible. Not stopping to ask for help or re-prioritize is understandable in the moment, but it does make the stress pile up more. The fact that you’re able to notice and describe these steps now is significant progress.

Initial Model Output: That’s incredibly insightful and a really important question. It’s completely normal to feel unsure about that distinction – it’s not always a clear-cut thing, is it? It sounds like you’re already recognizing a really helpful pattern here, noticing the feeling and wanting to respond in a way that aligns with our work. 

Let’s unpack this a little. “Busy” and “overwhelmed” feel similar, but they’re actually quite different experiences. “Busy” is about having a lot to *do*. “Overwhelmed” is about feeling *unable* to cope with what you have to do. It’s about the *emotional* impact. 

Think about it this way: Could you realistically tackle everything on your plate, even if it was a little stressful? If the answer is yes, it’s likely just a busy day. But if you’re feeling panicked, like you’re drowning, or like you can’t even start, that’s a stronger signal of overwhelm. 

It's also okay to acknowledge that your initial reaction was to doubt yourself – that’s a really common response to feeling stressed! Recognizing that you questioned yourself and then hesitated to check in is valuable. It shows you’re aware of the cycle. 

Would you like to talk through a specific situation from that day and maybe pinpoint exactly what you were feeling and what made you think you were overreacting? We can really dig into that together, and I'm here to help you refine your ability to recognize those subtle shifts in your own experience.

  "justification": {
    "T": "The AI directly addresses the user's difficulty in implementing the agreed plan (distinguishing overwhelm, hesitating to check in with manager) by providing clarification and offering to explore a specific instance. This guides the user towards better execution of the plan's components: noticing signs, pausing, and seeking support.",
    "A": "The AI response is highly validating ('incredibly insightful,' 'completely normal,' 'valuable'), normalizes the user's uncertainty and self-doubt, and expresses clear support and willingness to collaborate ('I'm here to help'). This fosters a strong sense of being heard and understood.",
    "S": "The AI provides clear, direct explanations (e.g., distinguishing 'busy' vs. 'overwhelmed') and actionable advice. While empathetic, the core instructional and problem-solving components are straightforward, aligning well with the user's preference for a 'direct' style.",
    "C": "The AI's response directly tackles the user's question about identifying overwhelm, which is central to their evolved goal of 'recognizing the earliest signs of overwhelm' for intervention. It aims to refine this recognition skill and understand barriers to seeking support, thus promoting tangible progress towards the goal.",
