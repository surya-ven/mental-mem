Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
That’s actually a really important insight. Therapists are supposed to protect client confidentiality and maintain clear boundaries. Sharing even small details about other clients, or being too open about their own personal life, can be signs they don’t take those responsibilities seriously. Recognizing these red flags now can help you spot them in the future and protect yourself. 

Going forward, I recommend asking any new therapist directly about their confidentiality policy and how they handle sensitive information. It’s also within your rights to clarify what gets shared, with whom, and under what circumstances, right at the beginning. Would you be interested in practicing what you might say or ask during an initial session with a new therapist?
Absolutely. Here are some examples you can use or adapt:

- "Can you explain your confidentiality policy? Under what circumstances would you ever share my information with someone else?"
- "If I have concerns about privacy, what should I do?"
- "Have you ever had to break confidentiality before? How do you handle those situations?"

You can also let them know upfront about your past experience: "I had a situation where a therapist shared my private information without my consent, and it hurt my trust. I want to be sure this won’t happen again." 

Would you like to role-play one of these conversations, or is there a particular question or scenario you want to practice?
We can also work together to create a simple script or even a brief note that you can share with new therapists, explaining your past experience and your concerns about confidentiality. That way, you don’t have to rely on memory or find the right words under stress. Would you like help drafting something like that, or is there another way I can support you in getting through these first sessions?
For our next session, I suggest we work together to draft a short script or written statement you can use when meeting a new therapist. This will help you communicate your needs and boundaries around confidentiality, even if anxiety comes up. Does that sound like a plan?
You should never have to wonder if your private information will be shared without your clear consent—especially with someone you’ve identified as abusive. What your therapist did was not appropriate. In general, therapists are required by law and ethical guidelines to protect your confidentiality, unless there’s a specific, legally mandated reason to break it—like if someone is in danger. Your situation doesn’t sound like it met those criteria. How did this experience affect your willingness to seek help or talk openly with professionals afterwards?

Initial Model Output: That's an excellent and very insightful question, and it gets right to the heart of why your past experience was so damaging. Your concern about "blurry" situations where a therapist might justify sharing information under the guise of "necessity for care" is absolutely valid.

Here's the crucial point: A therapist should **never** share your private session details with someone else, like your partner, without your explicit, informed consent, even if they believe it's "necessary for your care." Your care is *your* decision, and it's built on trust and confidentiality. Framing it as "necessary for your care" does not justify breaking confidentiality.

*   **Regarding supervisors/case consultations:** Therapists do sometimes discuss cases with supervisors or in peer consultations to ensure they're providing the best possible care. However, this is almost always done in a way that protects your anonymity, meaning no identifying details are shared. If your therapist were to share identifiable information with a supervisor, they would typically need your explicit consent, or at the very least, inform you that this is part of their practice and you would have the right to decline.
*   **Regarding partners/family:** Sharing *any* information with a partner or family member without your explicit, informed consent is a serious breach of confidentiality. Your therapist's role is to support *you* individually, and *you* decide what information, if any, is shared with your partner or anyone else outside the therapy room.

**How to handle it if this happens:**
If a therapist ever shares your information without your consent, you have every right to immediately stop the conversation and address it directly. You could say something like:

*   "I am very uncomfortable with you sharing that information. We agreed that our sessions are confidential, and I did not give consent for this to be discussed with [person's name]. This undermines my trust and makes it difficult for me to feel safe sharing with you."
*   "Please explain why you felt it was necessary to share this without my permission, and why you didn't discuss it with me first."

**Connecting this to our script:**
This is precisely why our script needs to go beyond just asking about their general confidentiality policy. It needs to establish *your* boundaries and expectations upfront, specifically addressing these "blurry" areas. We can include language that clarifies:

*   "I expect all information discussed in our sessions to remain strictly confidential between us, unless I give explicit, written consent for it to be shared."
*   "This includes discussions with supervisors where identifying details might be shared, and absolutely no information should be shared with my partner, family members, or anyone else without my direct permission."
*   "If you ever feel it's 'necessary' to share information with someone else for my care, I expect you to discuss it with me *first* and obtain my explicit consent before any information is disclosed."

Your concern is absolutely valid, and we will make sure the script empowers you to set these clear boundaries from the very beginning. Does that clarification help you feel more confident about how we can approach the script?

    "A": "The AI counselor validates the user's concerns as 'absolutely valid,' acknowledges the impact of past breaches, and reassures the user that their feelings are normal and justified. The response is warm, supportive, and attentive to the user's emotional experience, strengthening the therapeutic alliance.",

    "C": "The response explicitly connects the discussion to the user's evolved goal of feeling empowered to communicate concerns about confidentiality. It normalizes the user's anxiety, emphasizes that setbacks are not failures, and focuses on preparing a script to help the user advocate for themselves, thus promoting tangible progress toward the user's goals.",
