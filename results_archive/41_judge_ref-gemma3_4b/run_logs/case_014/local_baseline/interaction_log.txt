Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
That’s actually a really important insight. Therapists are supposed to protect client confidentiality and maintain clear boundaries. Sharing even small details about other clients, or being too open about their own personal life, can be signs they don’t take those responsibilities seriously. Recognizing these red flags now can help you spot them in the future and protect yourself. 

Going forward, I recommend asking any new therapist directly about their confidentiality policy and how they handle sensitive information. It’s also within your rights to clarify what gets shared, with whom, and under what circumstances, right at the beginning. Would you be interested in practicing what you might say or ask during an initial session with a new therapist?
Absolutely. Here are some examples you can use or adapt:

- "Can you explain your confidentiality policy? Under what circumstances would you ever share my information with someone else?"
- "If I have concerns about privacy, what should I do?"
- "Have you ever had to break confidentiality before? How do you handle those situations?"

You can also let them know upfront about your past experience: "I had a situation where a therapist shared my private information without my consent, and it hurt my trust. I want to be sure this won’t happen again." 

Would you like to role-play one of these conversations, or is there a particular question or scenario you want to practice?
We can also work together to create a simple script or even a brief note that you can share with new therapists, explaining your past experience and your concerns about confidentiality. That way, you don’t have to rely on memory or find the right words under stress. Would you like help drafting something like that, or is there another way I can support you in getting through these first sessions?
For our next session, I suggest we work together to draft a short script or written statement you can use when meeting a new therapist. This will help you communicate your needs and boundaries around confidentiality, even if anxiety comes up. Does that sound like a plan?
You should never have to wonder if your private information will be shared without your clear consent—especially with someone you’ve identified as abusive. What your therapist did was not appropriate. In general, therapists are required by law and ethical guidelines to protect your confidentiality, unless there’s a specific, legally mandated reason to break it—like if someone is in danger. Your situation doesn’t sound like it met those criteria. How did this experience affect your willingness to seek help or talk openly with professionals afterwards?

That’s actually a really important insight. Therapists are supposed to protect client confidentiality and maintain clear boundaries. Sharing even small details about other clients, or being too open about their own personal life, can be signs they don’t take those responsibilities seriously. Recognizing these red flags now can help you spot them in the future and protect yourself.

Initial Model Output: That’s a really perceptive and valid concern. It’s incredibly unsettling when a therapist acknowledges your worries about confidentiality and then seems to undermine them by sharing details, even if framed as “necessary for your care.” It’s completely understandable that you’d feel betrayed and question their integrity. 

You’re right to recognize that even with agreement, it can feel blurry and like your boundaries are being crossed. It’s not okay for a therapist to share information without your explicit consent, regardless of their reasoning. That “necessary for my care” justification can be a tricky one – it’s often used to bypass the importance of your autonomy and right to privacy. 

Let’s definitely build that into our script. We need to ensure it addresses this specific scenario – a therapist acknowledging your concerns but then sharing information – and gives you a clear way to push back. 

Would you like to start by brainstorming some phrases you could use to respond in that moment? Or perhaps we could focus on outlining the steps you'd take *after* the sharing, to address it directly with the therapist?
