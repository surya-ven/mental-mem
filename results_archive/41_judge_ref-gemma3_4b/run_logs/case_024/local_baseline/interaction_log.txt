But there was one situation where I felt confused about whether I should use it or not. My partner was acting kind of distant one evening, and I couldn’t tell if I was overreacting or if something was actually wrong. I started to get anxious, but I also felt like maybe I should talk to them instead of just doing the grounding thing. I wasn’t sure which was the right move, so I ended up not really doing either.

That sounds like a really solid plan. Remember, the goal isn’t to make the anxiety go away instantly, but to give yourself a tool to ride out those intense moments and remind yourself that you’re safe in the present. You’ve already shown you can be self-aware and reflective—this is just another way to build on that strength. 

So, for our next session, let’s agree that you’ll practice the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique whenever your anxiety about your relationship feels strong. We’ll check in together about what that was like, and continue building your toolkit from there. Does that feel like a good agreed task for the week?
That’s understandable, and it’s a sign of progress that you’re able to pause and try to reassure yourself before reaching out for reassurance from your partner. It’s also okay to need support from them sometimes—that’s part of being in a relationship. If you like, we can explore some ways you might self-soothe or manage the anxiety in those moments, as well as talk about how to share your feelings with your partner in a way that feels safe for you. Would you be interested in trying that together?
Yeah, I can do that. I’ll try the 5-4-3-2-1 thing whenever I feel the anxiety coming on. Hopefully it helps.
It’s understandable to feel disappointed or frustrated, but your reaction is not a failure—it's part of a process. It takes time for your body and mind to learn new ways of responding, especially when old fears get activated. You’re already starting to shift your relationship with these thoughts by noticing them and connecting them to your past, rather than automatically believing them or acting on them. That’s meaningful progress, even if it doesn’t always feel like it.

When you notice the anxiety rising, your first instinct is to try to push it away or distract yourself. Sometimes that helps, but sometimes it doesn’t.

A little bit. I still get anxious, but I try to remind myself that my partner hasn’t done anything to make me doubt them. Sometimes I can calm myself down, but other times I still want to ask for reassurance or check in with them more than I probably need to.

Initial Model Output: That’s incredibly insightful to share – thank you for being so honest about that. It’s *absolutely* normal to feel that kind of confusion. It sounds like you’re really trying to navigate a tricky situation, and it’s completely understandable that you hesitated. Recognizing that pull to talk to your partner alongside the urge to ground yourself shows a really good level of self-awareness. 

It’s not about *either/or* – it’s about finding what feels right *in that specific moment*. Sometimes grounding is the immediate, helpful tool, and sometimes connecting with your partner is the better approach. The fact that you felt conflicted highlights that you’re starting to understand your anxiety’s signals and how it influences your choices. 

Let’s talk about this a little more. Can you tell me a bit more about what you were feeling when your partner was distant? What specifically made you question whether to ground or talk?  We can explore how to better tune into those feelings and develop a flexible approach – one that allows you to respond with whatever feels most supportive at the time.

However, it could have more explicitly encouraged the user to reflect on what made the decision difficult, which would have more fully realized the plan's intent.",

The tone is supportive and conversational, with both reflective observations and direct guidance.",
    "C": "The response affirms that confusion and setbacks are normal, and reframes the user's conflict as evidence of progress in self-awareness\u2014directly supporting the user's evolved goal insight about setbacks and noticing anxious patterns.
