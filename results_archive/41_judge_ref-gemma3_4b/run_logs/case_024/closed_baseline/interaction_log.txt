That sounds like a really solid plan. Remember, the goal isn’t to make the anxiety go away instantly, but to give yourself a tool to ride out those intense moments and remind yourself that you’re safe in the present. You’ve already shown you can be self-aware and reflective—this is just another way to build on that strength. 

So, for our next session, let’s agree that you’ll practice the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique whenever your anxiety about your relationship feels strong. We’ll check in together about what that was like, and continue building your toolkit from there. Does that feel like a good agreed task for the week?
That’s understandable, and it’s a sign of progress that you’re able to pause and try to reassure yourself before reaching out for reassurance from your partner. It’s also okay to need support from them sometimes—that’s part of being in a relationship. If you like, we can explore some ways you might self-soothe or manage the anxiety in those moments, as well as talk about how to share your feelings with your partner in a way that feels safe for you. Would you be interested in trying that together?
Yeah, I can do that. I’ll try the 5-4-3-2-1 thing whenever I feel the anxiety coming on. Hopefully it helps.
It’s understandable to feel disappointed or frustrated, but your reaction is not a failure—it's part of a process. It takes time for your body and mind to learn new ways of responding, especially when old fears get activated. You’re already starting to shift your relationship with these thoughts by noticing them and connecting them to your past, rather than automatically believing them or acting on them.

A little bit. I still get anxious, but I try to remind myself that my partner hasn’t done anything to make me doubt them. Sometimes I can calm myself down, but other times I still want to ask for reassurance or check in with them more than I probably need to.

Initial Model Output: Thank you for sharing your experience with the 5-4-3-2-1 technique. It's really encouraging to hear that you tried it and found it helpful in some moments – that's a significant step!

Your confusion in that specific situation is not only normal, but it's a really insightful observation. You're not missing anything; in fact, you're pinpointing a very common dilemma. It makes perfect sense that you'd feel torn between using a self-soothing tool and wanting to address something directly with your partner, especially when you're uncertain about the cause of your anxiety.

The 5-4-3-2-1 technique is designed to help you regulate intense emotions in the moment, to bring you back to the present when your anxiety feels overwhelming. It's not meant to be a substitute for communication in your relationship, but rather a tool that can *support* more effective communication.

Sometimes, when we're feeling very anxious, our thoughts can become clouded, and it's harder to assess a situation clearly or express ourselves calmly. In those moments, using a grounding technique *first* can help you get to a place where you can then approach your partner from a more regulated and clear-headed space. It can help you discern if your anxiety is stemming from an internal trigger, or if there's genuinely something external that needs to be discussed.

It sounds like you're grappling with how to differentiate between anxiety-driven thoughts and legitimate concerns. We can definitely explore this further. How does the idea of using grounding as a first step to help you gain clarity *before* engaging in a conversation with your partner resonate with you?
