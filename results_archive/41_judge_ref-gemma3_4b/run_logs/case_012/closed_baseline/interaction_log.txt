Mem0 RAG Search: UserID='case_012_baseline_closed', Query='I did try to use the phrase when I noticed the guilt coming up, and sometimes it helped me pause and not spiral right away. But there was a situation this week that left me feeling a bit stuck. A friend made a casual comment about someone 'changing teams,' and it brought up a lot of doubt and discomfort for me. I wanted to use the kindness practice, but I wasn’t sure if it was enough, or even the right thing—I just felt unsettled and kept questioning whether I was overreacting or if I should have said something. It made me wonder if being kind to myself in those moments really addresses the uncertainty, or if I’m just trying to ignore it.'

Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
I think that sounds doable. I like the idea of having a phrase to come back to—something to remind me that it’s okay to be in this in-between state for now. I’ll try to notice when the doubt or guilt comes up and just pause for a moment, instead of jumping straight into criticizing myself.
That’s an important realization: you have ways of finding steadiness, even if they’re small or temporary. Reaching for perspective—through others’ stories or the knowledge that identity is often more complex than we’re taught—can help loosen the grip of self-doubt and isolation. And your routines, like walking and time with your kids, remind you that there are still solid, meaningful parts of your life, even as your understanding of yourself shifts.

As we look back over the past weeks, it seems you’re learning to hold both the discomfort of not knowing and the beginnings of self-compassion. You’re allowing yourself to grieve and to question, but you’re also starting to notice that change doesn’t erase who you’ve been; it adds to your story.

For our next session, could we agree together on a small intention or practice? Perhaps, whenever you notice guilt or doubt, you might try offering yourself a brief moment of kindness—maybe a phrase like, “It’s okay to not have all the answers right now,” or a gentle reminder that you’re doing the best you can. How does that feel to you as an intention for the week?
I'm really glad you shared this with me. Setbacks can feel discouraging, especially when it seems like old doubts and guilt are just as strong as ever. It sounds like you’re wrestling with some deep questions about identity and self-trust—wondering how things could change so dramatically after so many years, and whether these new feelings are genuine.

It’s understandable that this feels confusing and even destabilizing. After decades of knowing yourself in one way, it makes sense that sudden change would bring uncertainty and self-questioning. In this moment, I wonder what it’s like to sit with that doubt and exhaustion, rather than trying to fight it or reason it away. Are there any thoughts or feelings that come up if you simply allow yourself to acknowledge how hard this is right now?

You also mentioned feeling as if you might be “fooling yourself” or “doing something wrong.” I’m curious what those thoughts feel like—do they connect to any particular memories, beliefs, or fears from your past? Or do they feel more like a reaction to how sudden and surprising this experience has been?

If it feels okay, we can take things slowly and just notice what comes up for you, without needing to have all the answers right now.
The guilty part feels heavy and tense, like I’m waiting for something bad to happen. It’s a lot of self-criticism, like, “You should have known yourself better,” or “You’re letting people down.” The curious part feels lighter. When I think about the encounters themselves, or just admitting the attraction to myself, it feels like relief, like taking off a mask I didn’t know I was wearing. But then the guilt comes back and it’s hard to stay in that lighter space for long.
That’s such a gentle insight—you’re recognizing that the part of you feeling guilty is longing for reassurance and understanding, not punishment or shame. And your relieved, curious part wants you to hold onto that sense of authenticity and freedom, even if it’s fleeting. 

It sounds like these parts aren’t trying to hurt you, but rather to keep you safe in different ways: one by protecting your sense of continuity and responsibility, the other by inviting you to explore and accept who you are now. When you reflect on this, does it shift your perspective at all on how you can move forward? Or do you notice any feelings of compassion for yourself in this process?

Initial Model Output: Thank you for sharing this experience so honestly. It takes a lot of courage to try a new practice, especially when you're navigating such profound internal shifts, and then reflect on when it felt challenging.

It sounds like you *did* manage to pause, which is a significant step, even if the subsequent feelings of doubt and unsettledness were strong. That's a real testament to your commitment to this new way of responding to yourself.

It's completely understandable that a casual comment like your friend's would trigger a lot of feelings, especially given the deeply personal journey you're on right now. Those kinds of external remarks can really hit a nerve and bring up all sorts of questions about identity, acceptance, and how you're perceived.

Your question about whether kindness is "enough" or if you're "ignoring" the uncertainty is a really insightful one. It points to a common misconception: self-compassion isn't about making difficult feelings disappear or pretending they're not there. Instead, it's about how you *relate* to those feelings when they arise.

In that moment, the discomfort and uncertainty were real. Offering yourself kindness isn't about ignoring that reality; it's about saying, "This is hard right now, and I'm going to meet this difficulty with gentleness, rather than adding more pain through self-criticism or judgment." It creates a space *for* the uncertainty rather than fighting against it.

It sounds like you felt caught between the discomfort of the comment and the question of how to respond, both internally and perhaps externally. What was it like to sit with that "stuck" feeling, and what were the specific questions that came up for you about "overreacting" or "saying something"?

It not only acknowledges the user's feelings but also normalizes their experience and highlights the complexity of their emotional response. The AI reflects understanding of the user's vulnerability and encourages further exploration, which strengthens the therapeutic alliance.",

    "C": "The response connects the immediate experience (guilt, doubt, uncertainty) to the user's broader journey of identity, acceptance, and self-compassion. It references the user's struggle with old beliefs and the challenge of integrating change, and it frames self-kindness as a way to relate to uncertainty rather than erase it, which aligns with the user's evolved goal insight.",
