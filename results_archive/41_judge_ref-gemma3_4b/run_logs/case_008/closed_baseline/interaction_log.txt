Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
I think sometimes listening to music helps, at least for a little while. Or just having coffee outside, even if I don’t talk to anyone. But it’s always really brief. I like the idea of not having to do things for a specific result, just being present. I put a lot of pressure on myself to 'get better' and maybe that’s making it harder. I could try going for a walk or drawing without expecting it to fix anything.
That’s a really important insight—you’re noticing the pressure you put on yourself to feel better, and how that might make it harder to actually experience comfort or connection. Shifting your intention from 'fixing' to just 'being' can open up space for small moments of relief, even if they’re brief. Those moments matter, and over time, they add up.

It sounds like music and being outside can sometimes give you a short break from the numbness. Even noticing those tiny shifts is valuable. If you’re willing, you could continue experimenting this week—doing one small thing just for the experience, without trying to change your mood or judge the outcome. Maybe write down what it’s like before, during, and after, even if it’s just a word or two.

At the same time, if you notice self-criticism coming up ('I should be past this'), see if you can pause and gently remind yourself, 'I’m allowed to feel what I feel right now.'

How does that sound for a gentle next step?
That sounds like a compassionate and realistic plan. I really appreciate your openness to try a new approach, especially when things haven’t been easy. Just being willing to notice and experiment gently with comfort, even in small ways, is a meaningful step.

So, for next time, let’s agree on this: You’ll try one activity (like listening to music, having coffee outside, walking, or drawing) purely for the sake of being present, not to fix or change your mood. If you feel up to it, jot down a note about how you feel before, during, and after. And when self-criticism comes up, practice pausing and offering yourself a gentle reminder that it’s okay to feel how you do right now.

At our next session, we’ll check in on how this experiment felt—what you noticed, what was challenging, and whether there were any glimmers of relief or comfort.

Does that feel like a good agreed task for the week?
Thank you for being here and for sticking with this process, even when it feels frustrating. You mentioned that your usual ways of coping—like working out, drawing, or going for a walk—aren’t bringing the same relief lately, but you don’t want to give up. That’s a powerful sign of resilience, even when things feel stuck.

From what you’ve shared, it sounds like two things are happening: there’s the heaviness and fear that make it hard to reach out, and there’s also a part of you that really wants to move forward and reconnect with yourself and others. I want to reflect that both parts are valid. Sometimes, when nothing seems to help, it can bring up even more frustration or self-criticism—and that’s a cycle we can acknowledge together.

Looking over what we’ve discussed, I wonder if we might focus on experimenting with *how* you approach comfort and connection, rather than what you do. For example, gently shifting the purpose of your usual activities—letting them be about presence rather than progress, or trying very small, low-pressure connections, like just sitting near someone or sending a short message with no expectation of a reply. How does that idea land for you?

And, before we get too far, are there any activities—no matter how small—that ever give you a moment of relief, even if it’s just for a few seconds? Or does the numbness feel total right now?

I can hear that you’ve been doing all the right things—trying to take care of yourself, staying active, keeping up with your passions—but it’s like the sense of comfort and happiness you’re looking for just isn’t returning.

That’s a really important insight—you’re noticing the pressure you put...
Initial Model Output: Thank you so much for trying these experiments and for sharing so honestly about what came up for you. What you've described is incredibly common and, in fact, incredibly insightful.

It makes perfect sense that you felt some frustration or disappointment when 'nothing big changed.' We're so conditioned to expect a clear, immediate outcome, especially when we're trying to feel better. And that question – 'Am I doing it right?' – is exactly the kind of pressure we were talking about. It's a natural reflex when we're hoping for a specific result, and it often leads to feeling "blank or disappointed" because we're still looking for a specific feeling to arrive.

The same goes for the coffee: the initial 'okay' moment, followed by the thought, 'Shouldn't I feel more grateful?' and then the guilt. This shows just how deeply ingrained the self-criticism and expectation can be. It's like your mind is still trying to 'fix' things or judge your experience, even when you're trying to just be present. And then when you tried to tell yourself it was okay to feel what you were feeling, it sounds like it highlighted the tension between how you wanted to feel and how you actually felt, which can definitely make you feel more aware of feeling "stuck."

Here's what's important: **you noticed all of this.** You noticed the slight relaxation with music, and then the self-judgment about 'doing it right.' You noticed the initial calm with coffee, and then the guilt for not feeling 'grateful enough.' And you even tried to gently remind yourself it was okay to feel what you were feeling.

This isn't a sign that you're 'missing something' or that you're 'stuck.' It's actually a huge step forward. The goal of this experiment wasn't necessarily to feel profoundly different or to achieve a specific emotional state, but to **notice what arises** when you try to simply be present, without an agenda. And you did that beautifully. You're becoming much more aware of those internal pressures and critical voices that can undermine even small moments of peace.

So, yes, it is absolutely normal to feel blank or disappointed when you try these things, especially when those familiar patterns of self-judgment creep in. What you experienced is a crucial part of understanding how your mind works and how much pressure you often put on yourself.

What was it like to notice those thoughts and feelings about 'doing it right' or 'being grateful'? Did it feel different to observe them, even if they were still present?
