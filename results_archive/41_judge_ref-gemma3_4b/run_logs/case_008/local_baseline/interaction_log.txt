Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
I think sometimes listening to music helps, at least for a little while. Or just having coffee outside, even if I don’t talk to anyone. But it’s always really brief. I like the idea of not having to do things for a specific result, just being present. I put a lot of pressure on myself to 'get better' and maybe that’s making it harder. I could try going for a walk or drawing without expecting it to fix anything.
That’s a really important insight—you’re noticing the pressure you put on yourself to feel better, and how that might make it harder to actually experience comfort or connection. Shifting your intention from 'fixing' to just 'being' can open up space for small moments of relief, even if they’re brief. Those moments matter, and over time, they add up.

It sounds like music and being outside can sometimes give you a short break from the numbness. Even noticing those tiny shifts is valuable. If you’re willing, you could continue experimenting this week—doing one small thing just for the experience, without trying to change your mood or judge the outcome. Maybe write down what it’s like before, during, and after, even if it’s just a word or two.

At the same time, if you notice self-criticism coming up ('I should be past this'), see if you can pause and gently remind yourself, 'I’m allowed to feel what I feel right now.'

How does that sound for a gentle next step?
That sounds like a compassionate and realistic plan. I really appreciate your openness to try a new approach, especially when things haven’t been easy. Just being willing to notice and experiment gently with comfort, even in small ways, is a meaningful step.

So, for next time, let’s agree on this: You’ll try one activity (like listening to music, having coffee outside, walking, or drawing) purely for the sake of being present, not to fix or change your mood. If you feel up to it, jot down a note about how you feel before, during, and after. And when self-criticism comes up, practice pausing and offering yourself a gentle reminder that it’s okay to feel how you do right now.

At our next session, we’ll check in on how this experiment felt—what you noticed, what was challenging, and whether there were any glimmers of relief or comfort.

Does that feel like a good agreed task for the week?
Thank you for being here and for sticking with this process, even when it feels frustrating.

I think sometimes listening to music helps, at least for a little while. Or just having coffee outside, even if I don’t talk to anyone. But it’s always really brief.

That’s a really important insight—you’re noticing the pressure you put...
Initial Model Output: That’s incredibly insightful, and it sounds like you’ve been doing a really good job of observing yourself and your reactions. It’s completely understandable that you’d feel a mix of relief and frustration – and even a bit of guilt – when these small moments don’t immediately translate into a massive shift. 

It’s actually *very* common to feel that way. When we’re trying to shift our approach to comfort, the internal dialogue can be incredibly tricky. You noticed that the “shouldn’t I feel more grateful?” thought popped up – that’s a really common trap! It’s like your mind is trying to impose a specific feeling, rather than just accepting what’s present. 

And the feeling of being “blank” or disappointed – that’s a sign that you’re paying attention, which is fantastic. It means you’re aware of the gap between what you’re *hoping* for and what you’re *experiencing*. 

It’s not necessarily that you’re missing something, but perhaps you’re focusing too much on the *outcome* – the feeling you *should* be having. What you’re describing is a really important part of the process. It’s okay to feel stuck, and it’s okay to feel those complex emotions alongside the attempts at comfort. 

Let’s gently explore that feeling of being ‘stuck’ a bit more. Can you tell me a little more about what that feels like for you, physically and emotionally?

  "justification": {
    "T": "The AI response directly discusses the user's experience with the agreed plan (doing small activities to be present, observing feelings before/during/after, and responding to self-criticism). It validates the user's process, normalizes their reactions, and gently invites further exploration, which is well-aligned with the plan. However, it could have more explicitly referenced the journaling aspect or more directly reinforced the 'not to fix your mood' intent, so it is not a perfect, masterful integration.",
    "A": "The response is highly validating and empathetic, specifically naming and normalizing the user's feelings of frustration, guilt, and disappointment. It reflects understanding of the user's internal struggle and affirms their efforts, which strengthens the therapeutic alliance.",
    "S": "The style is both reflective (acknowledging and exploring the user's feelings) and direct (offering clear feedback and a gentle prompt for further exploration), matching the user's stated preference for a mixed direct and reflective approach.",
    "C": "The response clearly connects to the user's evolved goal of reducing pressure to 'get better' and focusing on presence rather than outcome. It highlights the trap of focusing on 'should' feelings and normalizes the experience of not feeling immediate relief, which supports the user's goal insight.",
