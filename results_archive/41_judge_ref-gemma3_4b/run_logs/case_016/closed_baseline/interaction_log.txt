Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
Honestly, I tried to take your advice last week and do one small thing for myself—I went for a walk by myself for the first time in months. It helped a little in the moment. But then the next day he barely got out of bed, and I felt guilty for leaving him alone even for half an hour. I keep thinking if I’m not there, something bad will happen, or he’ll just get worse. So now I feel like I’m back where I started—tired and stuck, and nothing I do seems to make any difference.
He sleeps all the time, barely eats, doesn't want to talk about anything—not even things we used to enjoy together. I can see he’s just checked out. I try to stay upbeat or encourage him, but it feels fake. Honestly, I'm exhausted. I’m worried about him, but I’m also starting to feel numb myself.
Thank you for being honest about your fears. It’s normal to worry about worst-case scenarios, but it’s important to separate what’s possible from what’s actually likely. Most likely, if you take a short break—like a walk—he’ll be in the same place when you get back. If he hasn’t expressed any intention to harm himself, that risk is low. And if he does think you don’t care, it’s not because you took care of yourself for half an hour; it’s because depression distorts things. Your responsibility is to yourself as well as to him.

You can’t sacrifice your well-being to try and protect him from every bad feeling. That’s not sustainable. The setback you felt last week isn’t a failure—it’s proof that this is hard and that guilt is something you’ll need to practice moving through, not around.

Here’s what I want you to do: Keep taking those small breaks—start with something simple, like another walk or some time reading alone, even if guilt comes up. Afterward, write down what actually happened (not what you feared might happen). This will help you see the difference between fear and reality over time.

Do you agree to try this for next week, and come back with what you notice?
If I keep taking breaks, even if he’s having a bad day, I keep thinking something will go wrong. Like maybe he’ll get worse, or he’ll think I don’t care about him. Sometimes I even worry that if I’m not there, he’ll do something to hurt himself, though he hasn’t said anything like that. More likely, I guess he’d just stay in bed and be miserable. But I still feel like I should be there, just in case.
I think I need support for myself first. I want to help him, but I don’t feel like I have anything left to give right now. I’m so tired all the time, and I keep thinking maybe this is just how things are going to be from now on. But I also realize that when I’m running on empty, I can’t actually help him. So I guess that’s my insight—I need to find a way to take care of myself if I want to be there for him at all.
