Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
That’s a valuable insight. You’re noticing that some progress happens when a neutral person is present to guide the conversation. It sounds like a mediator or continuing in counseling sessions together could be an effective way to keep discussions fair and on track, especially with important issues like finances.

For practical next steps, we could work together to come up with some guidelines for these discussions—things like taking turns speaking, or pausing before responding, which a mediator can help enforce. Would you be open to drafting a basic plan or set of ground rules for your upcoming sessions, so you both know what to expect and can focus on constructive conversation?
You’re doing your best to approach the problem with flexibility and fairness, but when he shuts down other options, it leaves you feeling stuck and unsupported. Wanting a mediator makes a lot of sense, given the pattern. Even though progress feels slow, the fact that he’s willing to go to counseling and consider a mediator is still a step—many people with rigid thinking resist outside help entirely. For now, I suggest we outline a concrete plan for the mediation sessions: set clear topics, agree on ground rules, and decide how to handle moments when the conversation stalls. Would you be willing to draft these ground rules with me, so you have something to bring into your next session?
Yes, I think that’s reasonable. Having something concrete would help. I’m willing to draft the ground rules with you and bring them to our next session.

Prompt (excerpt): PAST SNIPPETS:
That’s a valuable insight. You’re noticing that some progress happens when a neutral person is present to guide the conversation. It sounds like a mediator or continuing in counseling sessions together could be an effective way to keep discussions fair and on track, especially with important issues like finances.

Initial Model Output: That’s a very insightful and important concern, and it’s completely understandable why you’d feel stuck. Your worry about how the ground rules might be perceived is valid, especially given the pattern of communication you’ve described. You’re right to be mindful of phrasing them in a way that feels collaborative and helpful, rather than accusatory.

The key here is to frame the ground rules not as a critique of past behavior, but as a shared commitment to creating a more productive and respectful *future* discussion environment for both of you.

Here are a few strategies for phrasing that might help avoid triggering defensiveness:

1.  **Focus on "What We Will Do" (Positive Framing):** Instead of saying "No interrupting," which can sound like an accusation, you could phrase it as:
    *   "We will each have uninterrupted time to speak."
    *   "We will listen fully before responding."
    *   "We will take turns sharing our perspectives."

2.  **Emphasize Mutual Benefit and Shared Goals:** Frame the rules as something that will help *both* of you achieve your shared goal of open, fair discussions and practical solutions.
    *   "To ensure we both feel heard, we will..."
    *   "To help us stay focused on solutions, we will..."
    *   "So that our discussions are fair and productive, we will..."

3.  **Use "We" Language:** This reinforces the idea that these are rules for *both* of you, not just for him.
    *   "We will commit to..."
    *   "We will aim to..."
    *   "Our agreement is that we will..."

4.  **Focus on the Discussion, Not the Person:** Shift the focus from individual actions to the flow and quality of the conversation itself.
    *   Instead of "Don't shut down," consider: "We will explore all options before making a decision." or "We will keep an open mind to different perspectives."

5.  **Keep it Simple and Action-Oriented:** The clearer and more straightforward the rule, the less room there is for misinterpretation.

You're trying to create a constructive space, and being thoughtful about how these rules are presented is a crucial part of that. Would you like to try drafting a few together now, keeping these phrasing tips in mind? We can work on 3-5 rules that feel fair, neutral, and beneficial for both of you.
