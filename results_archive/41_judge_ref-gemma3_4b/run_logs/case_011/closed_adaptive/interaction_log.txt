Formatted Clinical Summary for Prompt:
Overall Focus: Supporting the user through cycling grief and persistent emotional pain following romantic loss, while introducing and reinforcing self-compassion as a tool for coping with setbacks and emotional self-judgment. The session emphasized the value of emotional witnessing, normalizing non-linear healing, and gently encouraging new ways of relating to personal suffering.
State: The user continues to experience significant emotional pain, marked by cycles of brief relief followed by renewed grief, especially when alone or reminded of the loss. They report frustration at perceived lack of progress and self-judgment for still caring, alongside a sense of discouragement and feeling 'stuck.' Despite this, they remain engaged and open to therapeutic support.
Milestones: ["User identified the cyclical nature of their grief, with alternating moments of reprieve and resurgence of pain.", "User acknowledged that honest expression, rather than suppression, provides some relief from emotional pain.", "User explored the concept of self-compassion, recognizing its absence in their coping and tentatively considering its application.", "Counselor normalized the user's ongoing attachment and grief as evidence of deep investment, not weakness.", "User agreed to practice noticing self-judgment and gently reminding themselves that their feelings are valid as a next step."]
Themes: ["Cyclical grief and the struggle for closure", "Self-judgment and perceived expectations for healing", "Isolation and heightened pain in solitude or with reminders", "Relief found in emotional expression and therapeutic witnessing", "Ambivalence toward self-compassion and vulnerability"]
Quotes: ["It\u2019s still hard. Some days I can almost forget for a little while, but then it comes back.", "I keep thinking about everything I lost, not just the person but the feeling of being alive and hopeful.", "I catch myself wishing things were different, and then I feel foolish for still caring so much.", "I know I should be moving forward, but sometimes it feels like I\u2019m just going in circles.", "I think the pain is worst when I\u2019m alone or when something reminds me of them.", "When I try to push the pain away or pretend it isn\u2019t there, it just seems to get louder.", "I don\u2019t really know how to do that. I\u2019m used to being hard on myself.", "Maybe I can try to remember that for myself."]
Reflections: The user remains in acute distress, cycling between fleeting relief and overwhelming grief. Their insight into the intensification of pain through avoidance, and the limited relief offered by honest expression, reflects a growing self-awareness. Introducing self-compassion required careful pacing, as the user is more accustomed to self-criticism. The user’s openness to experimenting with gentle self-acceptance, even tentatively, marks a meaningful therapeutic step. The session reaffirmed the necessity of normalizing emotional pain, validating ongoing caring, and supporting incremental shifts in self-relating as core elements of the healing process.
Focus Points: ["Explore the user's experiences with self-compassion and its impact on emotional intensity.", "Identify specific moments or triggers of self-judgment and discuss alternative compassionate responses.", "Continue normalizing the cyclical nature of grief and emotional setbacks.", "Examine the role of emotional expression versus suppression in managing pain.", "Assess the user's sense of safety and containment during periods of acute distress."]
Plan: Review the user's experiences with noticing self-judgment and attempts at self-compassion, exploring any shifts in emotional intensity or coping. Continue normalizing setbacks and reinforce the validity of the user's feelings. Expand on the role of self-compassion in healing and collaboratively identify additional supportive practices. Monitor for changes in somatic distress and assess ongoing needs for safety and containment.

Initial Model Output: Thank you for sharing that with me. It takes real courage and self-awareness to start noticing those moments of self-judgment, and the fact that you even *caught* yourself thinking you 'should' be over this, or judging yourself for turning down an invitation, is a huge step forward. Please don't underestimate the effort that takes.

It's completely understandable that simply telling yourself 'it's okay' might not always immediately change how you feel, or that you'd feel confused about what self-compassion truly means in practice. This isn't a switch you just flip; it's a new way of relating to yourself that takes practice and clarity, especially when you're used to being hard on yourself.

Let's look at that situation with your friend. When you weren't feeling up to going out, that was you *listening* to yourself in that moment. And then, the self-judgment came in, worrying you were 'pushing people away' or 'making things worse.' This is a very common dilemma: how do you balance self-care with the need to engage and prevent isolation?

Self-compassion isn't about avoiding things that might help you, nor is it about forcing yourself into situations that feel overwhelming. It's about being kind to yourself *in the face of difficulty*. In that moment, turning down the invitation might have been a compassionate act – acknowledging your capacity and need for rest, rather than pushing yourself into something that would have added to your distress. The self-judgment afterwards is where the 'being hard on yourself' comes in.

Instead of asking 'Am I being self-critical or avoiding?', perhaps we can explore: 'What was my *intention* in that moment when I decided not to go out?' Was it to avoid pain, or to honor a need for quiet and rest? And then, when the self-judgment comes, can you offer yourself the same understanding you would offer a dear friend who was going through something similar? You wouldn’t tell them they're 'pushing people away' if they needed a quiet night; you'd likely say, 'It's okay to take care of yourself.' It's about asking what you *truly need* in that moment, with kindness, rather than judging what you *should* be doing.

This is a really important distinction to learn, and it's perfectly normal to feel confused as you navigate it. The fact that you're even *asking* these questions shows incredible growth and a willingness to understand yourself better. We can continue to explore these nuances together.

The AI helps the user distinguish between avoidance and self-care, directly supporting the user's goal of managing pain through self-compassion.",
