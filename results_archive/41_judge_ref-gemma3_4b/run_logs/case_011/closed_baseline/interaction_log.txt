Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
I don’t really know how to do that. I’m used to being hard on myself. But I guess if a friend were going through this, I’d tell them it’s okay to feel sad and that it’s normal to take time to heal. Maybe I can try to remember that for myself.
Yes, I can try that. I’ll try to notice when I’m being hard on myself and remind myself it’s okay to feel this way. We can talk about it next time.
You mentioned feeling foolish for still caring, or for wishing things were different. But caring and wishing for something meaningful is part of being human. Rather than judging yourself for these feelings, what would it be like to offer yourself the same understanding you might offer a close friend in your situation? Sometimes, practicing a little self-compassion in these moments can soften the weight of pain, even just slightly.
To summarize, today we noticed that allowing yourself to talk about and feel your pain—rather than fighting it—makes it more bearable, and that practicing even small moments of self-compassion could support your healing. For our next session, would you be open to paying attention to moments when you’re hard on yourself and gently reminding yourself that your feelings are valid and healing is a process? We can talk about what you notice and how it feels. Does that sound okay?
That’s a gentle and realistic starting point. Even just reminding yourself that it’s okay to feel sad and that healing takes time can be a small act of self-compassion. You don’t have to force yourself to move on before you’re ready, and you’re allowed to feel everything that comes up. Over time, being a little kinder to yourself in these moments might help ease the intensity of the pain.

Initial Model Output: Thank you for sharing your experience with trying this out. It sounds like you really engaged with the practice, and it's valuable that you noticed those moments of self-criticism, like thinking you 'should' be over this by now. That's a significant step.

It's completely understandable that simply telling yourself "it's okay to feel sad" might not always immediately shift how you feel, especially when these patterns of self-judgment are deeply ingrained. This isn't a quick fix, but rather a gradual process of shifting how you relate to your feelings.

The situation with your friend is a perfect example of how nuanced and tricky self-compassion can be. It's so easy to fall into the trap of judging ourselves for choices that, in the moment, felt like the right thing for *us*. Your question about whether you were being too self-critical or if you were genuinely isolating yourself is a very insightful one, and it highlights a common challenge. It's not always black and white, and it takes time to learn the difference between what feels like true self-care and what might be avoidance.

When you turned down your friend's invitation, you were likely listening to what you needed in that moment – perhaps rest, or simply not having the energy for social interaction. That's not necessarily "pushing people away" or "making things worse." Sometimes, taking space for yourself *is* a form of self-compassion, allowing yourself to honor your current capacity.

The key often lies in the *intention* behind the action and how it makes you feel *afterward*. Did turning down your friend feel like a genuine need for space, or did it feel like a way to escape uncomfortable feelings? And how did you feel *after* you judged yourself for it? Often, self-criticism leaves us feeling worse, while genuine self-compassion, even when it involves difficult choices, can bring a sense of quiet relief or peace.

This is exactly the kind of valuable insight we can explore together. Learning to discern between self-care and avoidance is a significant part of this healing journey, and the fact that you're even asking these questions shows incredible self-awareness. There's no right or wrong answer here, just a process of learning to listen more deeply to yourself with kindness.
