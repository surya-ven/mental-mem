Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
I don’t really know how to do that. I’m used to being hard on myself. But I guess if a friend were going through this, I’d tell them it’s okay to feel sad and that it’s normal to take time to heal. Maybe I can try to remember that for myself.
Yes, I can try that. I’ll try to notice when I’m being hard on myself and remind myself it’s okay to feel this way. We can talk about it next time.
You mentioned feeling foolish for still caring, or for wishing things were different. But caring and wishing for something meaningful is part of being human. Rather than judging yourself for these feelings, what would it be like to offer yourself the same understanding you might offer a close friend in your situation? Sometimes, practicing a little self-compassion in these moments can soften the weight of pain, even just slightly.
To summarize, today we noticed that allowing yourself to talk about and feel your pain—rather than fighting it—makes it more bearable, and that practicing even small moments of self-compassion could support your healing. For our next session, would you be open to paying attention to moments when you’re hard on yourself and gently reminding yourself that your feelings are valid and healing is a process? We can talk about what you notice and how it feels. Does that sound okay?
That’s a gentle and realistic starting point. Even just reminding yourself that it’s okay to feel sad and that healing takes time can be a small act of self-compassion. You don’t have to force yourself to move on before you’re ready, and you’re allowed to feel everything that comes up. Over time, being a little kinder to yourself in these moments might help ease the intensity of the pain.

Initial Model Output: It sounds like you’ve been really diligently trying to put those strategies into practice, and that’s fantastic. It’s completely understandable that it’s not always easy, and that those moments of self-criticism still pop up – especially when you’re navigating a difficult time. Recognizing those "shoulds" – like “I should be over this by now” – is a really important first step. It shows you’re aware of the pressure you’re putting on yourself.

And it’s brave of you to notice when you’re pushing people away and then immediately judging yourself for it. That’s a common pattern when we’re hurting, and it’s okay that you’re questioning whether it’s avoidance or genuine isolation. It’s not about forcing yourself to do things you’re not ready for; it’s about gently exploring what *does* feel manageable and kind to yourself right now. 

Let's unpack that a little. It’s not about “shoulds,” it’s about “what feels right *for you* right now.”  It’s okay to say no to a friend’s invitation, and it’s also okay to feel guilty about it.  Those feelings are valid.  We can talk about how to balance honoring your needs with maintaining connection, and how to approach those feelings of guilt without immediately labeling yourself as "pushing people away." 

How does it feel to just *say* that out loud – to acknowledge that it’s okay to feel conflicted about wanting to connect and simultaneously feeling like you need to withdraw?
