That's really helpful detail. Those questions probably make you feel like you're on trial for past mistakes, and your body reacts fast—tight chest, racing thoughts. Here's something direct to do next time: As soon as you notice that physical reaction, try saying, 'I'm starting to feel defensive right now, and I don't want this to turn into a fight.' Then, take a pause—even if it's just a few deep breaths or a quick walk out of the room. Tell her, 'I care about this conversation and want to get it right, but I need a minute to calm down.'

Thank you for your honesty. You’re noticing a real pattern: raising your voice doesn’t get your point across—it usually leaves both of you feeling worse. Here’s something direct to try: when you notice yourself getting triggered or wanting to shout, pause and name what you’re feeling in that moment. For example, say, 'I’m feeling frustrated because I want to move forward, not keep rehashing the past.' This does two things: it slows you down so you don’t escalate, and it helps her understand your motives. Would you be willing to try this in your next conversation, and let me know how it goes?
Thank you for sharing more details. You’ve started noticing that when things heat up, the conversation shifts to old issues, and you feel like your partner turns your words against you. That’s a tough cycle, especially since you want to be supportive during her pregnancy. You also mentioned your drinking is social, not habitual. I want to be direct: Even though you don’t drink often, past incidents involving alcohol may have left her feeling uncertain or hurt, so those memories resurface when she’s feeling vulnerable or under stress. 

Instead of raising your voice, which you’ve already noticed doesn’t work, try focusing on listening and summarizing her concerns—even if you disagree. For example, you could say, 'I hear that you’re worried because of things I’ve done before. It’s important to you that I’m consistent now.' This helps her feel heard, lowering the chance she’ll go on the attack.

Would you be willing to try reflecting her feelings first before defending yourself? And is there a recent situation where you could have tried this?

Initial Model Output: That sounds incredibly frustrating and confusing. It’s really tough when you sense your annoyance rising and then she completely shuts down – it can feel like you’re walking on eggshells and unsure of how to respond. It’s understandable that you’re feeling stuck.

Let’s break this down. Her shutting down is a significant signal, and it’s not about you calling out your defensiveness *in the moment* when she does that. It’s about her needing space and feeling unsafe to engage. 

Instead of pushing for a conversation right then, your priority right now is to validate her feeling. You could say something like, “I noticed you got quiet and stopped talking, and I want to respect that. It sounds like you’re feeling like this is a bigger pattern than just this one time, and I want to understand that better.” 

Then, *wait*. Give her the space she needs. Don’t try to force her to talk. Let her know you’re open to talking when she’s ready. You could say, “I’m here for you when you’re ready to talk about it.” 

It’s okay to not have all the answers right now. Just showing you recognize her reaction and respect her need for space can make a real difference. How does that feel as a starting point?

T.A.S.C.S. Raw Scores from Judge: {
  "justification": {
    "T": "The response partially aligns with the agreed plan by addressing what to do when the user misses the moment to name defensiveness and needs to follow up after the argument. However, it does not explicitly encourage the user to name their defensiveness or reflect on their own pattern, focusing more on validating the partner and giving space. The guidance is supportive but does not fully implement the plan's core intent of practicing pausing/naming defensiveness and reporting back.",
    "A": "The response is warm, empathetic, and validating. It acknowledges the user's frustration and confusion, normalizes their feelings, and offers specific language to use. It also recognizes the difficulty of the situation and reassures the user that it's okay not to have all the answers. This goes beyond basic empathy and makes the user feel understood.",
    "S": "The style is mostly direct, offering clear, actionable suggestions and sample language. However, there are a few softer, more tentative phrases (e.g., 'How does that feel as a starting point?') that slightly soften the directness. Overall, the tone is clear and practical, matching the user's preference well.",
    "C": "The response supports the user's evolved goal of interrupting old patterns and building trust/accountability by suggesting respectful follow-up and validation. However, it does not explicitly reinforce the user's progress in noticing defensiveness or connect the advice to the user's insight about repeated practice. The connection is present but not made explicit.",
