Initial Model Output: It sounds like you're really trying to apply what we discussed, and that's incredibly valuable. Noticing your annoyance and *intending* to pause or name your emotions is a significant step forward, and I want to acknowledge that effort. It's completely understandable to feel unsure and frustrated when a new challenge like your partner shutting down emerges, especially when you're actively trying to change your own responses.

You've hit on a really important point: conflict doesn't always look like raising voices. Sometimes it's withdrawal, and that brings its own set of challenges, as you're experiencing.

To your questions:

1.  **Should you call out your defensiveness even if she goes quiet?** In the moment of a partner shutting down, pushing for immediate engagement or even an immediate self-disclosure like "I'm feeling defensive" can sometimes feel like more pressure to the person who's withdrawing. When someone shuts down, they're often feeling overwhelmed and need space.
2.  **How are you supposed to handle it when she shuts down?** Your instinct to try to bring it up later and apologize was a good one, showing you're still trying to connect and repair. Her comment about it being a "pattern" is crucial, as it hints at the deeper, unresolved issues we've talked about.

Here's an initial thought on handling a shutdown, which we can explore much more deeply in our next session:

*   **Respect the need for space in the moment:** When she shuts down, it's usually not the time for an immediate resolution. Trying to force a conversation can often escalate the withdrawal.
*   **Communicate your intent, without demanding engagement:** You could try a brief, non-demanding statement like, "I can see you're upset/need some space right now. I'm feeling [annoyed/defensive/frustrated] about what just happened, and I'd like to talk about it when you're ready. I'm here." This shows you're aware of your own feelings and willing to engage, but you're giving her agency over when she's ready.
*   **Give it time, then re-approach gently:** As you did, try to re-approach later, but perhaps even more gently. Instead of an immediate apology (which can sometimes feel like an attempt to close the conversation), you might start by acknowledging her feelings: "I noticed you seemed to shut down earlier, and I'm wondering if you're open to talking about what happened when you feel ready. I want to understand."
*   **Acknowledge the "pattern":** Her comment about it being a "pattern" is a key indicator that this isn't just about the phone. It points to deeper, unresolved issues that are impacting current interactions. This is exactly what we need to work on: how to address these "past hurts" and "patterns" constructively, rather than having them derail present discussions or lead to shutdowns.

This experience, though frustrating, provides incredibly valuable insight into the dynamics of your relationship and how different communication styles impact each other. It also highlights the complexity of breaking old cycles. We'll definitely use this as a core example in our next session to:

*   Review your experience with attempting to pause and name emotions in this situation.
*   Deepen our exploration of how her shutdown impacts you, and what alternative responses you can try.
*   Practice strategies for communicating when one partner needs space, and how to gently re-engage.
*   Begin to discuss how to collaboratively address those "patterns" or "past hurts" she mentioned, so they don't continue to disrupt your present communication.

You're doing important work by bringing these real-life challenges to our sessions. It shows your continued commitment to building a safer, more effective way to navigate conflict.

T.A.S.C.S. Raw Scores from Judge: {
  "justification": {
    "T": "The response directly addresses the user's agreed plan by acknowledging their attempt to pause and name defensiveness, and by providing guidance on what to do both in the moment and after the fact.
