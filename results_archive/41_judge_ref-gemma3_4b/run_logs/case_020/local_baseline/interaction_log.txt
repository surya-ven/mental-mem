When I used the phrases, honestly, it didn’t make much of a difference. The other person just seemed irritated or brushed it off, and we still ended up arguing. I tried saying, 'Let’s figure this out together,' but they looked frustrated and said I was just trying to control the conversation. It went right back to us defending ourselves and nothing got solved.
Thank you for being honest about how it went. It sounds like, even though you tried to change how you communicated, your partner didn’t seem open to it and the old pattern took over again. Here’s the key insight: Changing the tone of a conversation takes both people—it’s really tough if only one person is trying, especially when emotions are high. This doesn’t mean your efforts aren’t valuable; it just means that for real change, you’ll likely need to talk with your partner about trying a new approach together before you’re actually in the middle of an argument.

For our next step, I suggest you have a short, calm conversation with your partner—at a time when you’re not arguing—about wanting to work as a team on communication. You could say something like, 'I don’t like how we both end up upset when we argue, and I’d like for us to try something different together.' Ask if they’d be willing to agree on a simple ground rule for your next disagreement, like taking a short pause when things get heated, or both agreeing to use 'I' statements. 

Does that sound like something you’d be willing to try before your next session?
Sure. Last week, we argued about chores. I asked if they could help out more, and they said I was nagging. It turned into both of us listing all the things we do and neither of us really listening. In the end, we both just walked away upset and nothing changed.
Honestly, I tried using those phrases, but things didn’t really get better. We had another fight, and it felt just like before—both of us defensive and frustrated. I don’t know if I’m just not saying things the right way, or if it’s pointless to even try.
Great. For our next session, your task is to have a calm conversation outside of an argument and agree on one small ground rule or strategy with your partner for your next disagreement—something like taking a pause, using 'I' statements, or agreeing on a signal when things get heated. We’ll check in about how that conversation went and what you agreed on. Even just having that talk is progress.

Initial Model Output: That’s really frustrating, and it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling unsure now. It sounds like you took a brave step by initiating that conversation, and it’s disheartening when your partner doesn’t respond with the engagement you were hoping for. Their “Sure, whatever” can be really dismissive, and it’s valid to feel like they weren’t truly interested. 

It’s okay to feel like you might not have actually agreed on anything – sometimes those initial conversations can be a bit murky. Don’t beat yourself up about it. 

Let's focus on what you *can* do. Instead of trying to force an agreement right now, perhaps you could gently revisit the idea. You could say something like, “I noticed you didn’t seem to want to talk about a ground rule, and I was hoping we could find a way to communicate better when we disagree. Is now a good time to talk about it, or would another time be better?” 

It’s also important to acknowledge that their response doesn’t necessarily reflect how *you* feel or what *you* want. It’s okay to feel a little disappointed, but try to hold onto the belief that you're both capable of working together on this. 

How does that sound as a next step? Would you like to talk through some different ways you could approach bringing it up again, or would you prefer to just acknowledge your feelings about this experience for now?

  "justification": {
    "T": "The response directly addresses the agreed plan by acknowledging the user's attempt to have a calm conversation and suggesting a concrete, actionable way to revisit the topic with their partner. It provides a specific example of what the user could say, which aligns well with the plan's intent to agree on a ground rule outside of an argument. The guidance is clear and practical, showing good implementation of the plan.",
    "A": "The response is highly empathetic and validating. It acknowledges the user's frustration, uncertainty, and disappointment, and normalizes these feelings. The AI also recognizes the user's effort and bravery, and offers reassurance. The language is warm and supportive, strengthening the therapeutic alliance.",

There is a slight tendency toward gentle encouragement and validation, but this does not detract from the overall directness of the response.",
    "C": "The response is congruent with the user's evolved goal insight. It reinforces the idea that both partners need to be on board for lasting change and that agreements are best made outside of conflict. The AI encourages the user to revisit the conversation calmly and collaboratively, which supports the user's goal of effective, mutual communication.",
