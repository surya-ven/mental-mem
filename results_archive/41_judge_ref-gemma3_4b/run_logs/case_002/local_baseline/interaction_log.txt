Extracted RAG Context for Prompt:
Thank you for sharing how things went, even though it was tough. I want to be direct: setbacks like this are common and don’t mean you’ve failed or that things can’t improve. The pressure to "get it right" after making changes can sometimes spike your anxiety even more. This is a sign that the cycle of anxiety and performance pressure is still active—it takes time and consistent practice to break that pattern.

Let’s consolidate what we’ve learned: 
- Trying to "relax" with the hope that things will instantly improve can actually keep the focus on performance, which maintains anxiety.
- The real goal for now isn’t to "achieve" an erection or intercourse, but to completely take the pressure off and rebuild positive, pressure-free experiences with your wife.

Here’s a clear next step: 
1. Commit together with your wife to put intercourse on hold for now. Instead, focus on sensate focus exercises—a step-by-step plan to rebuild physical closeness and retrain your body’s response without performance pressure. I can give you specific, practical instructions for this.
2. Talk honestly with your wife about this approach: you’re a team, experimenting together, and setbacks are expected along the way.
3. Keep a simple log of what you try, how you feel, and any changes you notice—even small wins count.

Do you feel ready to try sensate focus together, and would you like detailed instructions to get started?
Great—you’re taking a proactive step by agreeing to this plan. For the next week or two, your agreed task is:

Practice the first stage of sensate focus with your wife—non-genital, non-breast touching only, taking turns giving and receiving touch, while focusing on sensations rather than performance or arousal. No intercourse or attempts at intercourse. Keep a brief log of experiences, feelings, and any small positive moments. We’ll review what you notice and adjust as needed.

Let’s check back in after you’ve tried this together. If you have questions or run into challenges along the way, write them down or message me, and we’ll troubleshoot together. You’re not alone in this process.
I hear how frustrating and discouraging this setback feels, especially after making real efforts. It’s completely normal to hope for quick improvement, but it’s also normal for this process to have ups and downs. Even with changes in approach, it often takes time for your body and mind to break out of old cycles—sometimes setbacks are part of that process, not a sign of failure.

Here’s what I want you to know:

1. One setback doesn’t mean you’re back to square one. The anxiety about the problem is deeply conditioned, and even with progress, it can resurface under pressure or expectation.
2. The fact that you’re still attracted to your wife and want things to improve is a strong foundation to build on.
3. Feeling defeated now is understandable, but it doesn’t mean things can’t improve—this is a signal that we may need to add some new strategies.

**Next Steps:**
- For now, put intercourse aside as a goal. Focus on all forms of physical closeness—touch, kissing, massage, even sensual play—without any expectation or attempt at penetration. This is called ‘sensate focus’ and it’s a proven way to retrain your body’s response, reduce anxiety, and build positive experiences together. If at any point you become aroused, allow it, but don’t shift the focus to intercourse.
- Talk openly with your wife and share that setbacks are normal, and that you’re both working as a team, not against each other. Sometimes including her in the process relieves pressure because it’s not just your burden to bear.
- If the emotional impact is heavy, consider checking in with your doctor about mood or anxiety. Sometimes counseling or short-term medication can help break the cycle.
- Keep a simple log of your experiences—what you tried, how you felt, and any small wins (even non-sexual ones). This can help identify patterns and build confidence over time.

Most importantly, don’t let a single setback convince you that lasting change isn’t possible. Would you like some more detailed guidance on how to do sensate focus exercises, or help with talking to your wife about being a team in this?
I tried to do what we talked about—cutting back on alcohol, focusing on just being close with my wife, and not putting pressure on myself for intercourse. But last night we tried to be intimate and the same problem happened. I lost my erection, and honestly, it felt even worse than before because I’d really hoped things would get better if I just relaxed. My wife was upset again and I just felt completely defeated. I’m starting to worry that nothing will change, and it’s making me even more depressed. I’m not sure what else I can do at this point.
Yes, I think being more structured about this could help. I’d appreciate clear, step-by-step instructions for what to do with the sensate focus exercises. I’ll talk to my wife and we’ll try this approach, and I’ll keep track of how it goes.

Initial Model Output: That’s incredibly frustrating and completely understandable why you’re feeling confused and pulled in two directions. It’s wonderful that you’re both engaging with the exercises and experiencing moments of closeness – that’s a huge positive step! 

It sounds like you’re grappling with a really important tension: wanting to connect deeply with your wife while also honoring the core principles of sensate focus. Let’s unpack this. 

The goal of the first stage of sensate focus isn’t to *prevent* arousal, but to *reframe* it. It’s about recognizing arousal as a sensation, not a goal in itself. When your wife becomes aroused, it’s a signal that you're successfully shifting the focus away from performance and towards simply experiencing touch and closeness. 

However, her frustration is valid. It’s natural to want to deepen connection, and it’s okay to feel a pull towards that. Here’s what I suggest:

1. **Acknowledge and Validate Her Feelings:** Start by saying something like, "I hear you saying it felt forced and unnatural to stop, and I understand why you were enjoying the moment. I appreciate you sharing that with me.” This shows you’re truly listening and taking her perspective seriously.

2. **Reiterate the Goal – Briefly:** Gently remind her of the exercise’s purpose: “We’re practicing focusing on the sensations of touch and connection, not on achieving arousal or intercourse. It’s about retraining our bodies and minds.”

3. **Offer a Gentle Pause, Not a Stop:** Instead of rigidly stopping, suggest a brief pause to reconnect with the focus. You could say, “Let’s take a moment to just breathe together and really notice how this feels – the warmth, the softness, the closeness. Just for a minute." 

4. **Communicate Your Hesitation:** It's okay to say, “I'm still learning to do this, and I want to honor the process. I'm a little worried about losing focus, but I want to be with you.” 

5. **Re-establish the Agreement:**  Remind yourselves that this is a team effort.  "Let’s agree to try to bring ourselves back to the focus together, and we can check in with each other about how it feels."

It’s okay that things get tricky! Setbacks are part of the process. The key is to approach them with open communication and a shared understanding of the goals. 

Would you like me to help you craft some specific phrases to use when this happens, or would you like to explore how to handle the feeling of wanting to deepen the connection while staying true to the exercise’s principles?
