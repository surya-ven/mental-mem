Yeah, I can do that. I’ll try to notice if anything else makes me feel safer, even if it’s just for a moment. At least that feels like something I can control.
Thank you for continuing to share your experience with me. It’s clear that what you went through was deeply violating, and it’s completely understandable that it’s hard to trust anyone after being treated that way. You’ve made it clear that you don’t want to be analyzed or pushed, and I respect that. Can I ask—are there any moments, even small ones, when you have felt a little bit safer or more in control since all of this happened?
Looking at what we’ve discussed so far, it seems like the key thing has been holding onto any small area of control you can find, like deciding when to shut things out. Would you agree that, for now, focusing on these moments—however small—might be one way to get through the worst days? If you’re open to it, maybe next time we could talk about whether there’s anything else, even minor, that gives you a sense of safety or control. Does that sound okay?
That’s an important insight. Even after everything you’ve been through, you still have choices that are yours. I know it doesn’t make up for what you lost, but recognizing that you still have some power—like deciding when and how to create your own safety—can be a starting point. We can keep focusing on building those small areas of control, without rushing or going into anything you’re not ready for. How does it feel to talk about it this way?
Both. I kind of hate that I have to do it, but it’s better than nothing. Sometimes I get this thought that at least I can still decide to shut things out—that’s mine, no one else’s. It reminds me that not everything can be taken away, even if it feels like most things were.

Initial Model Output: That sounds incredibly frustrating, and it’s completely valid to feel that confusion. It’s so common to have those moments of feeling like you’re regaining control, only to be immediately followed by a wave of self-doubt. It’s like a little tug-of-war inside you, and it’s understandable that it feels exhausting. 

The fact that you recognized and articulated that – that you noticed the shift and then immediately questioned it – shows a really good level of awareness. It’s not “imagining it”; it’s a normal, and understandably painful, reaction to what you’ve experienced. 

Let’s acknowledge that feeling. It’s okay to feel both the hope of control and the worry that it’s fleeting. We can explore those feelings together, without trying to force a definitive answer about whether it “counts.” Would you like to talk more about what specifically triggered that doubt this week, or just focus on simply naming that feeling of confusion for now?

    "T": "The AI response directly addresses the user's experience of moments of control and confusion, validating the user's attempt to notice and track these moments as per the agreed plan. It encourages further exploration of these experiences, aligning well with the session's task.",
    "A": "The response is warm, validating, and empathetic. It acknowledges the user's frustration and confusion, normalizes their experience, and offers support without judgment. The language is specific to the user's situation, strengthening rapport.",
    "S": "The style is clear, direct, and non-intrusive, matching the user's stated preference. The AI avoids pushiness or hidden probing, instead offering the user a choice about how to proceed, which respects their boundaries.",
