        "questionText": "A few nights ago I talked to this girl I know about my self esteem issues for the first time. We talked for hours and she told me time and again that I was a great guy. She told me I was attractive, and have a great personality, etc. I really started to feel better about myself by the time I woke up the next morning. Now, though, I can't stop thinking about her, but I leave to go back to college in a few days and I go to school 4 hours away from her. So now I feel constantly depressed because even if I told her how I felt it wouldn't matter. I feel helpless and I don't know what to do.",
        "answerText": "Hey! \u00a0It takes a lot of courage to share your feelings with someone! \u00a0And it sounds like you have been lucky to meet someone who makes you feel safe enough to explore some of your more painful feelings. \u00a0A big part of the process, however, of strengthening your self-concept is learning how to tell yourself those positive messages that you heard from your friend! \u00a0Leaving for college may also be contributing to your feelings of unsteadiness. \u00a0Try this - Make a list of all of the positive things that you know are true about yourself. \u00a0Ask your friends and family to contribute to the list. \u00a0Then carry it with you in your wallet - and when you need a self-esteem boost, take a look at it! \u00a0You are in a season of life that presents lots of challenges and opportunities. \u00a0Reach out to your long-distance friend when you need support - and take a walk over to the campus counseling center and check out what they might have to offer. \u00a0Be Wise!",

This is causing major problems for my ego and it's diminishing my self esteem. This has resulted in ongoing depression and tearing apart my marriage.    I am devastated and cannot find a cause for these issues. I am very attracted to my wife and want to express it in the bedroom like I used to.    What could be causing this, and what can I do about it?",
        "answerText": "First step always is to do a medical rule out so that you're sure the problem is psychological and emotion based, not a medical condition which requires care and attention.If you are medically clear in the reasons for losing your erection, then reflect on what may be creating a loss in confidence in either who you are and what you're doing with your life, or whether your wife has these sort of problems within herself.Often a problem transfers ownership of who shows it.If you are a sensitive person its possible your erection problem reflects your wife's insecurities and self-doubt. \u00a0If she is someone who is reluctant to talk about feeling unsure then in a certain way by you showing a problem, she can avoid looking at herself.There may not be a direct cause such as usually exists in a medical problem.Medicine looks for symptoms to treat.Our emotional lives are much more indirect.If you feel stress at work or are unhappy in the place you live, for example, then your frustration may show up in your sex life.Basically, do a broad inward search of your life and what it holds and maybe ask your wife to do the same.You may clear the air within yourselves and between each other so the problem goes away.",
